It's important to remember that DQs are exclusive to U.S. citizens or permanent green card holders, as they serve as qualifiers for U.S. championship events. Age and classification eligibility are standard requirements, with an exception for age if a fencer holds national points in a lower category. To qualify through a DQ, a fencer must finish in the top 3 or top 25% of the field, whichever is higher.

A: Shifting the Junior Olympics to early January eliminates longstanding scheduling conflicts with the international calendar and the January NAC. This change lets top juniors and cadets compete in both events, strengthening each tournament and giving athletes a clearer path through the season. Q: Is this change just for one season? A: No. USA Fencing expects the January Junior Olympics slot to remain through at least the 2027–28 season. After the LA28 Games, the overall calendar will be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.

Q: How will the new Junior Olympics dates affect the age-out calendar for junior and cadet fencers? A: As usual, age-out occurs immediately after the Junior Olympics.

Understand the Pool Rounds National tournament seeding is based on national rankings and ratings. Pools are made up of all of the fencers entered in the event who have not withdrawn before the 5 p.m. deadline the day before the start of the event. Top-seeded fencers typically each get their own pool. Seeding works like this: Imagine an event with 168 fencers, divided into 24 pools of seven fencers each. The top seed is placed in the first pool, the second seed in the second pool, and so on, until each pool has one fencer. Once the 24th-seeded fencer is placed in the 24th pool, the process goes in reverse, meaning the 25th-seeded fencer is placed with the 24th seed, the 26th with the 23rd, and so on.

This “snake” or zig-zag pattern continues until all the pools are filled. At national tournaments, pre-tournament seeding is determined by the fencer’s national ranking, followed by their classification (A, B, C, D, E, or U/unrated). If there are a number of fencers who are rated C23 (C is the classification, 23 is the year they earned that classification — 2023), but none of those fencers has national points, the seeding of these fencers will be randomly assigned, placed below those with B classifications but above those with D, E, or U classifications. These C23 fencers would also be seeded above C fencers with classifications earned in earlier years (like C22 or C21). USA Fencing makes every effort to avoid placing fencers in pools with other fencers from the same clubs and/or division. The priority for avoiding conflicts is first to avoid club conflicts based on the fencers’ primary club and second to avoid conflicts with fencers from the same division.

Pro tip : The classification deadline — the last day we accept new ratings — is 5 p.m. the day before the competition starts. That means, for example, that if the organizer of a regional event from the week prior has not provided the national office with the proper documentation before this deadline, the results and new ratings earned in that regional tournament will not be eligible to be used for the national tournament. Also, if a fencer earns a new rating during a national tournament, that rating will not be applied to the fencer’s profile until after the tournament ends, even if they have another event they are fencing later in the weekend. More about pool play: In pool play, a fencer competes against every fencer in their pool in a bout to five touches or three minutes — whichever happens first. Once the bouts in the pool are finished, fencers are ranked first by their winning percentage (which ensures fairness for fencers in pools of different sizes), next by how many victories they achieved in that pool and then by their indicator — touches scored minus touches received.

It’s not just a fencing move—it’s an essential part of your fencing defense strategy. So, if you’re new to fencing or just looking to refine your parrying abilities, this guide is for you. Let’s ensure you don’t disappoint your coach or team by mastering the basics of a good parry as a good fencing tactic. What Exactly is a Parry in Fencing? A parry is essentially a defensive action used to thwart or redirect an opponent’s attack. In fencing, this is achieved by maneuvering your sword to intercept and control the direction of the opposing blade. While the concept might sound straightforward, executing a precise parry requires practice, timing, and strategic foresight. Knowing When to Parry Understanding the timing of when to parry is crucial. A parry is most effective fencing move when it’s an integral part of your reaction strategy against incoming attacks.

{"id": "web-32fcf04ed1-1", "text": "scenarios when a parry becomes your best response: Direct Defense : This is the most traditional use of a parry. When an attack comes, you respond by parrying and then counter-attacking, known as a riposte. Avoidance : Sometimes, the best parry is avoiding the hit altogether, either by stepping back or to the side. Pre-emptive Strike : If you have the right of way, and it’s tactically sound, launching an attack before your opponent strikes can negate the need for a parry. How to Execute a Parry Effectively To perform a parry, you need to engage your opponent’s blade by positioning yours to intercept and control the attack. Here are some critical aspects of a successful parry: Controlled Motion : Your blade should meet your opponent’s with precision. Use the strongest part of your blade (the forte) against the weakest part of theirs (the foible). Minimal Movement : Keep your movements concise. Overextending can leave you vulnerable to follow-up attacks. Proper Timing : Timing is critical in fencing. A well-timed parry can be the difference between scoring a point and being scored upon.

The Four Fundamental Parries in Fencing Fencing features several parry techniques, but four basic ones cover most defensive needs.

Execution : Rotate your wrist outward, elevating your blade toward your opponent’s head or slightly higher. Adjust your arm based on the height required. Parry Four (Quarte) Technique : High inside block. Execution : Inward wrist turn, raising your blade toward the opponent’s head or above. Coordinate your arm’s movement with your wrist to protect your upper torso. Parry Eight (Octave) Technique : Low outside block. Execution : Outward wrist turn, directing your blade toward your opponent’s lower midsection. Adapt your arm’s extension based on the incoming attack’s trajectory.

Parries Other Than Fundamental Ones There are eight types of parry in total. Although, we have discussed the fundamental ones, it’s important to learn about the other types too. Parry 1 (Prime) : This parry protects the inside low line. The blade is moved to the fencer’s lower left side, with the hand turned inward. It’s often used to block low-line attacks, especially thrusts directed at the lower torso or the hip area. Parry 2 (Seconde) : This parry defends the outside low line. The blade is directed down and to the right, with the hand turned outward. It’s particularly useful in sabre fencing to block low cuts and in épée to protect against low-line thrusts. Parry 3 (Tierce) : This parry covers the outside high line. The blade is positioned to the right and up, with the hand turned outward. It is commonly used in sabre fencing to defend against high-line cuts and in foil and épée to protect the upper shoulder area. Parry 5 (Quinte) : This parry is generally used to protect the head.

Advanced Strategies for Mastering Parries in Fencing Parrying in fencing is more than just blocking an attack—it’s about control, precision, and setting up counterattacks. To refine your fencing parry technique, it’s essential to understand how different types of attacks influence your defensive approach, practice strategic responses, and develop seamless parry-riposte sequences. Choosing the Right Parry for the Situation Different fencing parries are designed to counter specific attack patterns. Recognizing an opponent’s movement allows you to select the most effective defensive action. Against Direct Attacks: Use Parry 4 (Quarte) or Parry 6 (Sixte) to redirect an opponent’s blade away from your target area. Against Low Strikes: Parry 7 (Septime) and Parry 8 (Octave) are ideal for deflecting attacks to the lower torso or legs.

Against Feints: Counter by using circular parries to follow the opponent’s blade movement and maintain control. Against Compound Attacks: A well-timed counter-parry can neutralize an opponent’s layered offensive actions. Enhancing Reaction Speed and Execution in Parry Speed and accuracy play a critical role in successful parrying in fencing. Here are a few techniques to refine your reaction time: Drill-Based Training: Use parrying drills with a partner to develop instinctive responses to real-time attacks. Blade Control Work: Focus on fine wrist adjustments rather than large arm movements to maintain efficiency. Timing Practice: Reacting too early or too late weakens your defense. Train with progressive speed drills to sharpen timing. Combining Parries with Footwork for Maximum Defense Effective parrying isn’t just about blade work—it’s also about positioning. Footwork determines whether you successfully execute a parry or leave yourself open to a follow-up attack.

Angled Steps: Combining lateral footwork with a parry can shift you out of direct attack lines. Counteroffensive Setup: A perfect parry should seamlessly transition into a riposte, ensuring a quick counterstrike. Understanding Parrying in Different Weapons Each fencing discipline—foil, épée, and sabre—requires a different approach to parrying: Foil: Parries must be precise since only touches to the torso count. Right-of-way rules make counterattacks essential. Épée: Any touch scores, so defensive fencing requires strong parries and controlled ripostes. Sabre: The priority system means parrying is about quick blade deflections rather than prolonged engagements. By focusing on timing, blade control, and footwork, you can improve your fencing parry technique and become a more effective defender.

Well, you might have heard about fencing vs HEMA, but they’re not the same thing. Let’s break down the main differences in a simple way, so you can figure out which one might be your cup of tea. But first, you need to know what are fencing and HEMA… Have you ever wondered who the true legends of fencing are?

You can think of epee as dueling to first blood, the dueling style that stepped in when authorities decided that they didnt want duelists killing each other. You would step out into a field or square in the morning light with your rapier and, under the watchful eye of the seconds and a referee, you would attempt to be the first to hit, with the point and with enough force to make them bleed. Obviously, you didnt want to get hit; really obviously, you didnt want to get killed (and it would be naive not to think that, much of the time, a duelist legally \"limited\" to first blood would step out intending to do much worse to his opponent). EPEE RIGHT-OF-WAY. So the rules of epee are, on the surface, much simpler than the priority rules of foil and sabre.

If you wonder why foil and sabre attacks are defined as they are in the rules, watch some epee --- moving forward without extending, starting too far out of distance, bent-arm attacks all will tend to get you hit. In epee, a good attack should be delivered with a care to protecting your own target, more so than in foil or sabre, but with a technique that can be easily translated. One of the earliest things you should be doing in a bout is watching for how your opponent delivers their attack - do they lift their hand, bend their wrist or elbow, and bring exposed target forward into your reach? Often a good counterattack consists of placing your point in the way of a sloppy attack (its also a good move psychologically - the feeling of hitting the other fencers point\" with your hand/ wrist/ forearm is demoralizing, and even if they just feel the contact, but no hit, early in an attack will often cause a very aggressive fencer to get more cautious).

A good epee on-guard should use the bell guard to protect at least the forearm. You can try to get your entire arm behind it, but that involves straightening your arm to an extent that gives important leverage advantages to your opponent (their attacks intending to move your blade will be more effective) and also may cause them to stand too far out of your own reach (however, it also can back off a fencer who is having too easy a time reaching you!) . You should be relaxed (avoid the death grip on your weapon), with your knees bent but your foot not too far out, front foot pointed forward, and with your weight balanced, ready to move forward or backward. Your back foot should be under you - one of the most common problems of fencers at many levels is that as they move forward, they \"drag\" their back foot, and it winds up too far behind them, severely limiting their lunging distance.

Some fencers protect themselves by keeping their arms back well away from their opponent's reach; this approach is workable but will take considerably more practice to perfect. Often, the basic strategy with this stance is to wait for, or to provoke, an attack, parry strongly with blade control during a close of distance, and deliver a riposte with no or minimal release of the blade. Attacks must be quick, still with extension as the first step (\"lead with the point!\"), with good supporting footwork and very good point control. Look for this style - incomplete training will leave more openings for you than most other approaches: parries may be predictable and avoidable, or released much too early and vulnerable to a quick counterattack; the on-guard arm may be closer than the fencer realizes, and can possibly be reached with a quick attack; the point control may be lacking, and a deep counterattack into the body will work because the fencer consistently misses their first shot.

Attack these fencers shallowly, to the arm and front edge of the shoulder, possibly the thigh. Body position is important - many fencers square off, with the back shoulder swung somewhat in. They may be comfortable this way, but there are a few things that you must consider. First, the classical position of having the back shoulder way back was developed by people who were worried about loss of life - it wasnt invented on a whim. Having your shoulder around presents more target to a deep attack - a lesser problem if you can train yourself to pivot away from such an attack. But there is a much more important consideration. Try this - take up a squared position, and extend fully to touch a wall.

Of course, many fencers with \"bad body position\" swing their shoulders around to deliver an attack, but many dont, unaware of the distance they are giving up. There are also balance advantages getting into and out of lunges from the classic position as well, if the back arm is used properly, but we wont go into those here. Consider blade position as well - if you opponent attacks by first going after your blade, a lifted point makes it easier for them. Best position against blade attackers is with your point aimed right at, or just alongside, their bell guard. What do you look at while you're fencing? That varies - some fencers watch their opponents eyes, some pick a potential target and focus on it, some focus on the back-up target that they will switch to if an initial stroke misses, some dont feel like they focus on anything in particular at all.

Epee competitive strategy is mostly a blend of three actions - attacks, defense with ripostes, and counterattacks. A truly good strategy should be a blend of all three, but most fencers will settle into an approach that uses one action more than the others. The most important, and often the hardest, aspect of any strategy is the concentration and focus you need to find, follow, and hit target when target is available. You need to be able to process information - at first, simple things picked up in training, then competition-based follow-up information (you probably need a trained observer to tell you what youve done wrong and how to correct it), then competition-day advice from a coach before or during a bout (youll find, early on, that such advice is more confusing than useful - thats pretty normal).

Next, youll be able to step on to the strip with some sort of plan specific to certain opponents - sometimes it will work, sometimes not, and youll have to decide if the failure is due to a strategic problem or to an execution problem. There will be a frustrating period during which youll get flashes of insight just after a bout (oh, I should have done this!!!! ), but that stage for most people leads to the ability to think, strategize and adjust during the actual bout. So, for many experienced people, bad days will be lapses in focus rather than failures in techniques. ATTACKS . A fencer whose main strategy is to attack must continually look for openings.

Remember, youre not going to hit them with your eyes - the openings have to be in respect to your blade and point. With some point control, attacks that can be delivered directly are easiest (aim early for best results, especially if you're just learning): extend, aim, and use footwork to move the point to target. Some targets are reachable with some angulation - coming around the corner of the bell guard - and some may be reachable with a flick that bends the blade in around that same corner. The best angulation is delivered with a normal thrust and a movement outward with the hand during the attack - if you bend your wrist to angulate at the beginning, it provides immediate target to a counterattack and too much warning of your intent. Flicks are difficult to do without opening your own hand and wrist target to a counterattack. Also, flicks are best perfected in practice on either a dummy or a well-padded partner - badly-done flicks are brutal, and I would not recommend numbing your opponents arm as a sporting strategy (be aware that some fencers do use it as", "source": "https://www.profmcdarby.com/Pages/Fencing_Club/Basic-Epee-Info-Etc.htm", "title": "Epee - Introduction and Strategy Guide", "tags": [], "date": ""}

Both of these types of attacks can usually be defended with a slight adjustment of the bell guard position, rather than a blade-on-blade parry. Move your hand slightly toward the direction that the attacks are coming past your guard. The other parts of opponents' on-guard for you to analyze is the position of the front foot - is it close enough for you to hit? Careful - your reach starts at your shoulder, so low target is often farther away than it feels. Remember, however, that attacks to the leg or foot open your own arm to counterattacks, and so are of limited use against someone who usually counterattacks. A high feint with a drop to low target is more likely to work against fencers who are trying to defend, or who back away but are slow removing that front foot.

Also, if they are constantly moving, is there a pattern or rhythm to the movement that you can take advantage of? Analyze , too, the initial reaction of your opponent to your attacks. If they parry, is it always the same way? You may be able to take advantage of this. Remember, however, that in many cases you may want them to actually parry - the contact will often cause a break in their rhythm, and of course for that split second you will know exactly where their blade is. But when they push on you, don't push back; you rarely will have the leverage to push through a parry. From the contact, a quick redouble - move the point quickly to open target somewhere else - will beat many ripostes.

A foil-like feint and disengage that evades the parry completely will often cause them to keep trying to parry, and that may block your disengage, especially if the opponent has earlier foil training. Another reason that you may want to provoke a parry is that foil-trained fencers will sometimes parry, release your blade (in foil, they have right-of-way at this point and don't have to worry about what you'll do then), and riposte, leaving you an opportunity for a quick remise into the now-opened target. Look at the section on defense for a discussion of ripostes. If your opponent counterattacks, is it coming from a predictable angle? You may be able to adjust your hand position so that their counterattack is diverted from your target, or just to cover the target that youre opening during your attacks. Think of attacking through their counterattack. Use your opponent's scored points to tell you what you are showing to them - if they keep hitting a particular area of your target, you must be leaving it open.

Many counterattackers have good focus and point control; one of the common mistakes made against counterattackers is attempting an attack to a target that is much too deep (far away)- youre trying to reach the body and getting hit on the arm as you try it. Against many counterattackers, you may need to attack the blade as a first step, disturbing their focus and forcing them to take time to regain their point control. Sometimes a simple beat will do this, especially if executed (as they are supposed to be) as an early-to-middle part of your extension, so that your rebound from the beat puts your point very close to their target while they are recovering from the beat. Beats in epee are less effective at actually opening target than in foil, usually, and can be tricky to deliver against a blade thats almost parallel to yours - you may need to angulate the blade slightly to make good contact.

Attacks on the blade may also provide you with enough time to allow you to attack to your opponents body, or may offset a reach disadvantage. Its important to remember, when you are first starting, that its target , not the other blade, that is your first consideration - swinging at the other weapon just \"because it's there\" wont score many points and can be a disadvantage in several ways. An important aspect to attacks (or counterattacks) is the angle of delivery . You are much better off moving your point forward in a direction where, if it misses your intended target, it continues into other target. For instance, an attack to the arm that, if it misses, tracks off into the air is not as good as one that continues up the arm and may hit the shoulder, armpit, or mask.

Attacks may consistently fail against a good defender or counterattacker - if you dont feel comfortable moving to another strategy, try changing your rhythm, or try countertime: feinting an attack (or delivering a very shallow attack), dealing with their response, and then hitting them. Fleche attacks can be effective if unexpected, but usually need to hit immediately - a fleche attack carried to a second or third step requires fast handwork from a fairly awkward position to keep you from being hit. Fleching itself is difficult to do until you have good control of your foot-body interaction - you need to be able to step over without swinging your torso around. Make sure that your back foot's push is preparatory, just shifting your weight, and the primary push comes off your front foot, or the move is just a big step. You also will need to practice how to deal with the results of an unsuccessful fleche attack - for most people new to them, running past is the best follow-up; later, a halt at infighting range may be better.

Footwork is critical to any epee strategy. For attackers, forward controlled speed is very important. You want to land in a position to deal with the consequences if your attack is unsuccessful. Dont overlunge, leaving yourself off balance on one foot and often your hand low. Be balanced enough that, if your point is near target and you are not in immediate danger of being hit yourself, you can continue to move in (or at the very least, keep your point in the way of their forward movement).

For counterattackers, an immediate retreat that stays just close enough to deliver the counter is most important. Often a good counterattack involves moving back just a bit more slowly than the attacker is moving forward. For most epee grips, point control comes from the first two fingers and the thumb - holding or squeezing with the back fingers makes point movement slow and large, and may dip the point (if your point consistently dips at the end of your attacks, you're squeezing - relax your grip). It is easier to aim early in an attack and deliver the point with your footwork; a loose grip makes the fine-tuning of this approach possible. Aiming done in the middle of an attack is possible but harder to do consistently. If your blade is bent, you may need to turn your hand so that the point hits target flatly and will push in.

A strategy based on defense means that you need the other person to make the first move. However, you dont want to give them too much time to think about how to attack you. A defender can only afford to be totally passive against a fencer who wants to attack quickly. How do you do this without actually initiating your own attack? Keep moving, both forward and backward, and try to force them to adjust while trying not to get too close. Take shots at your opponents hand and short lunge attacks to the arm, which will keep them from settling too much into a comfort zone but will put you at minimal risk. Small beats on your opponent's blade will also be effective at driving them to your tune. Use the fencing strip intelligently - dont back up too early, or too far, if you can help it.

Being up against the end line is distracting (sometimes more so to the other fencer, but thats rare and hard to take advantage of). Moving them back can compel them to attack. As much as possible, use your bell guard and the inner part of your blade to parry by moving your hand laterally, which allows you to cover without taking your point too far out. The farther out your point goes on a parry, the more it has to travel to come back into target. Hand-out / point-in parries work well, especially if you extend through the contact, almost a time-hit, a parry-riposte simultaneous combination. If you take a large, point-out parry, like foil fencers do, you cannot afford to release the blade on your riposte, because their point will be closer to you than yours is to them. If you can, try to control their blade through most of your riposte, riding down it to target.

Of course, whatever you do cant be so repetitive that it becomes predictable, or a good, experienced opponent will take advantage of it. Beat parries have limited effectiveness in epee, but binding (wrap-around) parries can work well - remember, you have to clear the incoming blade before it reaches any target (people often get hit in the thigh or head trying these), and your last move will usually be to push the attacking blade out with your hand while using your fingers (you have to keep a relaxed grip, which is tough while doing this) to bring the point into target.

If you want to experiment as an attacker, vary your hand height, but dont forget the arm openings it presents to your opponent. Opposite-handed fencers will be coming in from a different angle, so parries have to cover those angles. COUNTERATTACKS . Epee is a race - first one to target wins. With a machine to determine timing, it often makes sense to attack into an incoming attack, hitting them before they reach you. Hand position can be critical to counterattacks - if your hand is too low, or too far back, your counters can be slow enough to produce double hits or be too late completely. Also, as is true for attacks, you want your arm as protected as possible by your bell guard as you extend, and your shoulder far enough around to give you maximum reach.

When possible, extend into and through the attack. Speaking of reach, most counterattackers are best served by trying to limit all hits in a bout to the arms, unless they have a considerable reach advantage. A good counterattacker should have good point control, and so should be able to hit an opponents arm more than the opponent can hit their arm. To do this, the counterattacker must use footwork to limit their opponents reach - dont let them reach your body. If they can hit your arm more than you can hit theirs, it probably is time for more training and/or a change in strategy! If you have the reach advantage, adjust the distance so that your opponent cannot reach your body but you can reach theirs. If your opponent can do this, you may need to interrupt their initial counters to give yourself time to reach them - see the section above on attacks against counterattackers.

Good counterattackers possess or develop a good feel for the other point - since any defensive moves you make are very subtle, you need a good concept of the position and direction of the threat. Eventually, evasion can become a major part of your strategy - actively moving your arm (which sacrifices distance and opens target, but if they are aimed elsewhere and closing, that shouldnt matter) or your body out of the way as you counterattack. It can also be useful for defensive strategies, especially time-hit approaches. There is a concept that applies to the other strategies but it most pertinent here: the  point in the pipe . Imagine your opponents arm is in a pipe just a bit bigger than the arm (and that their body is in a similar box with a vertical center line). Your job is to keep your own point in the pipe, especially when you are not really focused on a particular target. When your blade gets diverted, get your point back into the pipe (or if your opponent is close enough, onto that center line of the box). This will produce accidental hits, as well as keep your opponent under constant threat.

It makes counterattacks quicker and easier as well, even against blade contact. The pressure that sets off the epee is often supplied by the attacker - you just intercept their forward progress, whether your point is purposely there or not. Also, keeping you point aimed just next to the opponent's hand makes it more difficult for them to make effective moves on your blade. When your opponent contacts your blade, they will almost always have a leverage advantage over you. It is almost always a mistake to push back, to wrestle with your opponent - in most contact situations that persist (presses, binds, several types of parries), the first blade to release and move elsewhere usually produces the first hit. GRIPS . There are a startling number of epee grips available. Each general type tends to have advantages or disadvantages. French Grips are sort of straight, with enough curve to comfortably fit the hand. They require good finger control, and as a practice weapon they can help you develop improved point control.

Many fencers find the weapon's balance point, which is almost in the hand, to be much more comfortable. French grips can be shifted forward and backward to provide additional reach - shifting back beyond a certain point affects finger control (attacks tend to become more limited) and ability to defend, and requires a very strong yet controlled hand. The hand and forearm are a bit more protected than with most pistol grips, as long as it is not held too far back. Attacks on the blade tend to be harder to recover from with a French grip - held properly and extended, leverage is a trifle worse than with other grips. It's b etter for pure attacking and counterattack strategies, poor for anything requiring blade-to-blade power. The pommel may get in the way when infighting. Since a rules change, it was becoming common for a while to see French grips strapped to the wrist.

In general, a tall fencer with long reach, good point control and quick footwork is best suited to a French grip. Pistol Grips . It is not really fair to lump all pistol-type grips under one heading, but Ill try to keep this general enough to justify it. Pistol grips, which come in a dizzying variety of styles and sizes, generally provide set grip points for the back fingers. This can strengthen most aspects of epee fencing requiring power, especially defense, but the use of the back fingers at the wrong times can interfere with precise point placement. Since point control is so critical to epee, this tends to be unlearned quicker than in foil, where even experienced fencers deliver full-grip slashes with the wrist and forearm. Still, point control may be slower to come with a pistol grip. Some grips put the edge of the last finger actually below the edge of bell guard and therefore vulnerable, and the hand and forearm are slightly more open, although they dont necessarily appear to be to an opponent. It generally isnt possible to shift your hand position much and increase reach.

It generally isnt possible to shift your hand position much and increase reach. The balance of the weapon is out the blade a bit, which makes the weapon seem heavier (especially when you're first getting used to it) and may dip the point, although fencers generally adjust. The shorter grips make the arm/wrist positions of infighting easier. What sometimes happens in clubs is that each member settles on a grip that they feel comfortable with, which is good, but when weapons fail and fencers borrow, it can be a disadvantage, even though the differences are often more psychological than actual. If you are using a pistol grip properly, it shouldn't be too difficult to shift from one type to another. Italian Grips . These are uncommon enough that they are difficult to discuss, and when you do see fencers with them, many are not really wielding them in the classic Italian manner, which historically included binding them to the hand and wrist.

Point control is maintained more with the entire lower arm, as are many actions. An incredible amount of power is available but limited flexibility, especially in close. An Italian weapon wielded subtly can be an excellent arm-to-arm weapon but less effective against quick attacks deep to the body. Good footwork and distance is essential to properly use this grip. IN-FIGHTING . This is an approach that actual duelists would probably disparage, but generally you wont get killed doing it with an epee (that's a joke). The first requirement, of course, is to get close enough that you can in-fight without getting hit on your way in - a good counterattacker will rarely find themselves having to in-fight. Some parrying styles, with a control and step in, almost inevitably lead to it. The first thing to remember is that its hard to in-fight if you cant get your point between you and your opponent.

Its best if you can get the point between your bodies; trying to hit with an outside angulation is very hard unless theres a huge height difference. If you are closer than an epee length, and the points between you, your hand cant be between you - proper in-fighting involves moving the hand out and placing the point in. It may involve raising the hand above the head, dropping it low, or pulling the elbow out or back past the ribs; while youre doing it, though, your hand grip is important. A relaxed grip will allow you to snap the point to available target, but a tight grip makes a jab necessary, which is slower, harder to land properly, and sometimes brutal. OVERVIEW .

A fencer should not settle on a single strategy to the exclusions of the others, but a preferred approach is useful. A good fencer will also, over time, develop and practice a deep bag of tricks that will allow them to adjust to the strategies and techniques they face in competition. Using the Strip and Distance . GETTING USED TO IT. Inexperienced fencers can often be recognized by their lack of awareness of where they are on the strip: they may back up until its obvious that they will back right over the rear line, or they may refuse to back up when they have lots of room, or they may retreat diagonally over the sideline. Those errors most fencers will correct, but many of them never learn to use the strip to help them strategically. THE RULES . First, a review of the rules that relate. The Back Lines: if you pass beyond these lines with both feet , your opponent gets a touch.

The Side Lines: The rules on this have changed more than once of late. If you step off the side of the strip with a single foot (and it has to touch clearly beyond the sideline), a halt is called and you get backed a meter from where you started the action, and any actions begun after the halt (theoretically-but-not-applied, any action started after your foot touches out-of-bounds) on your part don't count. If you use offensive actions that carry you past your opponent, you need to pass them before stepping off to not be penalized the meter. Also, if you step off in the middle of a fencing action, once your foot hits the ground off the strip, a halt should be called and you can no longer hit your opponent (you can hit them with the action that carried you off, however, subject to the referees interpretation), but they have a beat of fencing time to hit you.

If a halt is called because a fencer has stepped off the side, the meter loss should be applied when the two are reset - it is important to know why the halt was called in such circumstances. Under some circumstances, when a fencer near the end line steps off the strip, this meter penalty may back them off the strip and give the other fencer a touch. Another rule, rarely applied, provides a yellow card for the fencer that jumps off the strip to avoid being hit. USING THE LINES . The Back Lines can be your friends or your enemies. The most important consideration for a fencer is: what happens when you or your opponent backs past the warning lines? If you get distracted thinking about your strip position, and most fencers do, your opponent has an advantage. If they get distracted, wondering if you know, what you might do and what they should do, you may have a focus advantage. What is most important is: how does their behavior change? Do they refuse to back up? Do they switch suddenly to the offensive? If their reaction is predictable, you can take advantage of it - the trick is having some idea of what to expect.

If their reaction is predictable, you can take advantage of it - the trick is having some idea of what to expect. Strategies: Using the Back Line. If your opponent is using your back line against you by backing you up, there are a couple of adjustments you can make. First, step in to meet them (carefully) when fencing starts, dont wait for them to come to you - this will give you a bit of extra room. Second, try to stop their advance with short attacks that will probably not work but will probably not get you hit, either - it is difficult to continually advance into such attacks. You can use your opponents back line in several ways. First, with some fencers you can actually back them over it - I dont personally like to get a touch that way, but its a valid strategy. Second, you can use the closeness of the back lines for its distraction, but be aware that there are some opponents you do not want to do this with: some fencers become wildly unpredictable when cornered, and may do things that you are not prepared to deal with. So who do you want to back up?

Fencers who fade away from your attacks while counterattacking, especially if they have more reach than you do, are one type of opponent you want backed up - they need room to fade through, and being too far back takes that away. Another, less obvious opponent is the thinker, whose attacks are well-planned and who takes their time preparing them - this type of fencer is much more likely to rush when feeling cornered. And how do you back an opponent up? Sometimes its a simple matter of continually advancing, and sometimes you need to attack in a way that keeps you protected but makes them retreat. Strategies: Using the Side Lines . If you have no reason to do otherwise, stay in the middle of the strip - on some strips in crowded venues, that will keep you from hitting off-strip objects, including referees. It will make you less likely to step off as well. On grounded strips, fencing near the edge increases the chances of an off-strip floor hit that may be counted against you (yes, they may be counted for you, but you dont want that, do you?), and stepping partly off a", "source": "https://www.profmcdarby.com/Pages/Fencing_Club/Basic-Epee-Info-Etc.htm", "title": "Epee - Introduction and Strategy Guide", "tags": [], "date": ""}

However, many opponents will mount fleche attacks that carry past you, and most of them will have a preferred side to fleche to. Because of the sideline rules, you want these fencers off the strip as soon as possible during these actions, so decide which side theyre going to and move to that side. Referees may be slow to call halts when a fencer closes and fences alongside their opponent, but they have little choice if one fencer is off the strip. It may be a good idea to request clarification of calls from the referee to remind them of what they should be watching for under these circumstances - a simple question of, Were they off the strip? when a touch is scored may get the refs keeping their eyes out for just that.

If fleching is one of your primary moves, you may want to try to move laterally (if your opponent will move over with you) to give yourself more room to do it. If your opponent habitually moves to the sideline while fencing, try to figure out why. Opposite-handed fencers may move to their outsides to consciously close off some angles, but often its a subconscious reaction to the change in hand positions. If a fencer moves to the side and you dont want them to, you may want to fence them diagonally on the strip (if you can do this and not step off) - often theyll move back in rather than fence in that unfamiliar configuration. You may, however, have to move over to not give up an angle you are not used to fencing at. Strategies: Distance . As in all fencing weapons, the distance between opponents is critical.

That varies, based upon a lot of factors. First, you want to stay out of your opponents easy reach, which depends upon your opponents height, arm length, quickness, and depth of extension and footwork. Now you know why experienced fencers, when first on-strip with someone they dont know, keep quite a distance from each other for a while. Second, you want to be in a position from which you can score, if possible, with the simplest and quickest footwork. So there are two critical distances in a bout: theirs and yours. You shouldn't just settle into theirs without expecting to get hit. If you move into your opponent's distance, either attack or get out - unless you are purposely trying to provoke an attack from them. How is distance determined?

Many of your opponents will rely on the position of the two blades to determine distance, a fact that you can use strategically - such opponents can be drawn in by pulling your blade in, or held more at bay by extending. Long Distance . If your opponent is staying well away from you, using reach to counterattack, you may need to back them up and use the rear line to prevent further withdrawal. You can use the staying away strategy also - advance to meet your opponent to give you maximum withdrawal room. A good counterattack under these circumstances is usually delivered early (before you have moved out of reach, obviously) in such a way that if you miss, you dont get hit by the attack. A good extension, body position, and focus of the point are all critical. Against an opponent using this tactic, it is possible to fence in what is called counter-time - you start your initial attack, divert and/or control the counterattack while still moving forward, then hit with a riposte. That sounds a lot easier than it is. Footwork can be continuous advances, advance(s) leading into a lunge, or jumps, or possibly a fleche.

The fleche can be used to cross the greater distance with an initial attack (this has to be quick, deep, and focused), or as part of counter-time (slower, more controlled, with a need for quick changes). Close Distance . Many actions will bring fencers in close to one another, and the amount of fencing allowed at close quarters varies hugely among referees. At any rate, youll need to be able to deal with it. When in close, the most critical ability will be moving your hand into position to get the point on target. Many fencers mov e their hands up and strike down at target - there is a certain logic to this because there should be a lot of target to pass by on the way down. However, drawing the hand out to the side or back along your flank will also position the point in a way that can be manipulated by more normal finger control.

You may find your opponent making body contact - in epee, often the contact has to be very obvious for a halt to be called, and a fencer pretty much has to clearly move their opponent with the contact for a yellow card to be imposed (this rule, based partly upon bad interpretation of the original French, allows a wide range of application). Close-contact fencing should be practiced, like any other aspect of fencing, during practice bouts. Being able to hit an opponent who steps in, or who purposely fleches by at close distance will discourage the move. You can practice the move by advancing in as you attack, by fleching, or by holding your ground against a very aggressive opponent. It can be drilled, but simulation of actual bout conditions may be better. Using the Rhythm and Pacing . DIFFERENT FENCERS USE DIFFERENT RHYTHMS.

It is not unusual for epee fencers to start a bout in a slow, deliberate rhythm that speeds gradually up as the fencers get used to each other. USING RHYTHM AS A STRATEGY. You can sometimes use an opponents rhythms against them: if you know that your opponent is primarily a sabre fencer (especially if they are fencing both weapons in the same event), you may want to speed up your own rhythm - this will only work if you can keep your technique and, more importantly, point control at the faster rhythm. Making a sabre fencer fence at a sabre speed often interferes with their epee technique - their hands will tend to cut rather than thrust. Foil fencers can be fenced with broken rhythm - fence into their parry-riposte pattern and then remise, or attack with a break in the middle - they will riposte or attack when they should be retreating or defending.

This is not easy - the best way, if you can do it, is to establish your point in the way of their forward movements. This can be dangerous - holding your weapon in their way leaves you vulnerable to controlling actions on the blade (but not every opponent will do these, or they may do them so badly that the actions are easily avoided), and quick counterattacks into attacks may not be easy to control - look for repeating patterns and ways to intercept their incoming target with your point. If a fast-moving fencer continually gets hit or almost hit repeatedly, they will tend to go slower. Be careful that you dont slow down too much - its one thing to be cautious, another to be asleep.

Heres a list of attributes that are useful to competitive fencers, followed by a ranking list for each weapon... ANALYSIS - IN-PROGRESS . Perhaps the most difficult of the analytical skills for a fencer is to be able to figure out what is going on while it is going on. Why did that attack fail? Why did you just get hit? Are there patterns being shown by your opponent? How is your opponent's strategy changing as the score changes? Have you tried the same basic move too many times?

Have you given up on something too easily? Have you stuck with something much too long? This is a skill that is built up over time, first by relying on a coach's eyes to see what you and other fencers are doing right or wrong, then to planning your response before a bout, then to understanding just after a bout, then to gradually being able to do it \"on the fly.\" You occasionally need to be able to analyze the tendencies of a referee this way as well - what actions are they seeing or not seeing? That is much more critical in foil and sabre. ANALYSIS - OBSERVATION . You are going to face opponents with whom you are unfamiliar. You should be able to watch them in other bouts and see tendencies and techniques that you can use to plan your approach to them.

Do they fence badly at first and then improve? Is their opponent just too different from you for their responses to be predictive? Are they so good that they can to do just enough to win against lesser opponents without revealing very much (that paranoia alone may be useful to notice)? You will probably do better if each time you step on the strip you have some idea of what sort of fencing you'll be facing. And you might want to take notes, or have someone do it for you - build yourself an opponents' database. If you're planning on competing for a while, such a written record of opponents, along with notes on your own bouts, can be very useful. Observing referee tendencies with other fencers can be very useful, more so for foil and sabre. ANALYSIS - SELF .

Develop the ability to decide what you are doing well and what needs improvement, what strategies are your best alternatives and what are the best back-ups if your primary approach isn't working (and you'll need to decide if something isn't working because of something your opponent is doing or because of some failing on your part). Being able to focus on specific moves during practice sessions is tough if you don't know what moves need to be worked on. For some, those skills will need to be drilled in, over and over; for some, they need to be part of sparring, worked in in the context of actual fencing time; many will need a combination. COACHABILITY . Perhaps the biggest reason that fencers drop out of the sport after some competition experience involves the phrase, \"But it works!\" Almost everyone that starts does some things \"wrong,\" but there's something odd about many \"wrong\" things: such a style may produce a lot of success, especially against other inexperienced opponents but even against experienced fencers who don't expect \"wrong\" actions and haven't been taught how to take advantage of them.

A beginner may have success on the local level, even the regional level, but there will be some opponents they just will not be able to beat and a plateau of ability that they will have problems moving beyond. Being coached from a \"wrong\" style to a \"right\" style almost always involves a frustrating interim where nothing seems to work and success seems impossible, and it is during this interim that many fencers give up and find something else to do. Frustration may also come from fellow club members adjusting to the wrong actions - the main reason they are wrong is because they can easily be countered. Just keep in mind that usually having success with a faulty approach implies physical gifts that will eventually make proper technique very successful. COORDINATION . This is partly overall coordination and largely coordination of specific fencing-type techniques. The ability to control what your feet are doing independent of what your hand is doing is huge (theres a reason why fencing improves your tennis game and vice-versa). Drills can build coordination.

{"id": "web-280bc4c7a8-47", "text": "oing independent of what your hand is doing is huge (theres a reason why fencing improves your tennis game and vice-versa). Drills can build coordination. My personal recommendation is drills that duplicate actual fencing as closely as possible - for instance, doing footwork drills with a weapon in hand, or handwork drills with variations that require some choice in response, such as practicing two parry-riposte combinations and allowing your partner to choose which of two (or some other limited number) attacks to launch. EXPLOSIVENESS . This is the ability to quickly reach target when some indication of availability is recognized. It is a combination of recognizing when a moment has arrived and reacting with proper, controlled footwork to make a quick touch - see it, reach it, hit it. Lunges and fleches are the main way of delivering that explosion. FOCUS . This is a broad area. It can mean staying in the moment, not allowing yourself to be distracted by unimportant details. It can also be related to control, and ability to actually hit target when target is available. Are you actually aiming at something? Specific aim is more critical than in the other two weapons.

Specific aim is more critical than in the other two weapons. Are you ready to react when opportunity presents itself? Can you immediately put off the last bad action / good action / odd referee call out of your mind? POWER . Useful but not absolutely necessary, the ability to deliver power through your weapon can greatly determine which strategies will work and which techniques to apply. Power can be overused and can result in brutality, so caution is advised. As a beginner, developing an effective power game will be more difficult than other strategic foundations (power can make it hard to develop the finesse needed for good point control), but if you stay at it you will become very difficult to deal with. Power often comes from the technique involved in proper leverage. REFLEXES . Like any sport, you train your reactions in fencing, and your raw ability to recognize an action and react to it has a basic foundation that can be heightened, but this always has limitations in the individual.

Slow reflexes can be compensated for by early recognition, planning, and manipulation of distance. Also, technique training can help - moves done correctly, under control, are usually smaller and therefore quicker - you can react late but get to the parry-riposte stage faster with a small, controlled parry. RELAXATION . A highly critical skill. The resistance of tension, really. You dont have to be calm, but you need to be able to keep your muscles, especially in your hand, from tightening up to the point that actions become large and uncontrolled. A slight squeeze of your grip during your attack will move your point quite a way from where you were aimed (if the point drops at the end of an extension, or rebounds sharply, you're squeezing, probably with the back fingers). If your hand is cramping, or you feel the need to shake it between points, you're holding on too hard - and if you're holding on too hard, point control is limited.

One fencer (A) stands on guard, back foot against a wall, foil in hand (mask on). The second fencer (B) finds her/his lunging distance. Fencer B then takes his/her guard and proceeds to attack in a line of her/his choice. It is fencer A's job to parry the incoming attack and riposte immediately (fencer B will recover). Note that if fencer A chooses a poor parry, fencer B should make the touch (i.e. it should be a committed attack). Once the fencers become comfortable with both roles in the drill, an additional level of complexity should be added by allowing the attacking fencer to perform actions on the blade prior to the attack.

In this case immediately should be defined as: before the opponent can even think about a recovery or a remise. This is a very simple drill and can be executed in any line. Moreover, it should be practiced in all lines whenever possible. Start out of distance, with an aggressor and a defender. The aggressor should perform an advance-lunge to either the high line or low line as previously decided. The defender then performs his/her choice of parry, and ripostes (direct by detaching the blade, direct along the blade, or indirect, but not compound) immediately. The defender's goal is to make a successful riposte, while the agressor, his attack having been foiled, attempts to recovery to his guard as quickly as possible to avoid the riposte. Note: the defender must not lunge with her/his riposte. Variations: This drill can be performed in many variations.

The general form of this exercise was written in 1932 by Luigi Barbasetti as: \"The master makes a strong thrust and then recovers rapidly, whereupon the pupil, without lunging, executes a riposte before the instructor can recover.\" Openings and Responses: By now the student should be familiar with the 3 main openings: the invitation, the engagement, and the extension. They should also be familiar with the 3 simple attacks: the straight thrust, the disengagement and lunge, and the glide. For each of the openings, one of the simple attacks supplies the most direct/efficient means for taking advantage of the opening. For the invitation, it is the straight thrust (make sure to close the line!), for the engagement, the disengagement and lunge, and for the extension it is the glide.

Fencer B will then offer one of the 3 openings, either inviting in 3rd, engaging fencer A's blade in 3rd, or extending to the high line. As soon as the opening is offered, fencer A will respond with the appropriate simple attack in the high line and touch. After a certain amount of time they should switch roles. Obviously the above is a bit simple, so let us extend it. Now, still from a stationary guard, allow fencer B to choose the starting line at random. That is, fencer B will invite or engage in any of the 4 lines, or extend to either the high line or the low line. Fencer A will respond with an appropriate simple attack. Switch roles. Finally, to complete the drill, do it 'in time with mobility'. That is, allow fencer B to control the movements as well as the timing of the opening.

Obviously this can continue to be extended until it eventually resembles an actual assault. A couple simple extensions are: first, to allow fencer B to attempt to parry-riposte, and second to change the distance so that fencer A is using an advance lunge, possibly with a feint, to which fencer B can respond with his/her choice of parry, which fencer A must evade and continue through for the touch. 2004-2005 Lesson Schedule (top) Fall Semester: [F] September 3rd: First meeting of the Fall 2004 Semester, returning students only.

To execute them successfully, it is extremely necessary to give these actions most careful study. They are absolutely essential and you must master them, since faulty execution will but subject you to danger. The tactics are simple and normal. The Actions Against the Blade of an Opponent present a number of possibilities, particularly as the thrusts are generally made horizontally. While it is true that the defender has the advantage, because the attacker is able to find only small openings, it is also true that the attacker has the means of enlarging the existing openings and of increasing their number. We shall limit ourselves to a few brief suggestions since a manual at best can give only the fundamentals.

Spring Semester: In the fall semester we successfully built a vocabulary of fencing actions. You are now all familiar with advances, retreats, lunges, appeal, cross-steps, jump backs and forwards, and maybe even fleches. You know the four lines, the four simple attacks, simple, circular, semi-circular and ceding parries, you've done single and double feints, disengagements, and deceives, blade seizures, pressures, changes of engagement, transports, envelopments, expulsions, simple, change, and circular beats, disarms, counter-parry ripostes, simple ripostes, compound ripostes . . .

What you may not be as comfortable with is when to use all those actions, and how to respond to your opponent's openings. Now that we understand the basic mechanisms of these actions I want to begin putting them in context and looking at how to apply them. As we go we will also add more details and variations to the executions of the actions, and add in new actions, such at the counter attacks. By the end of the semester I hope to confront you with many technical and tactical situations so that you can develop a more complete understanding of how and when to use the actions we learned last fall--then you will be able to really start fencing. Oh, and I want to give you the chance to get lots of practice so that the actions you already know will flow smoothly and naturally.

The old Italian method was built on this principle of the ideal art of fencing, and a weapon for serious encounters was always used, never a practice spada.

Her mother whispered to me, \"She's so shy, I'm not sure if this was the right choice.\" It's a scene I've witnessed hundreds of times over years of running fencing camps. That first-day nervousness.

This will be the first time in three years that USA Fencing has been able to hold its national competition in the regular format! We were lucky enough to have a national fencing competition last year, but the points were combined from the canceled 2019-2020 season and last season.

For the first time, Fencing Summer Nationals and the July Challenge will be held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. All around, we are just incredibly thankful for the chance to get our fencing on track once again for the biggest competition in the United States. Now the big question is – how do fencers qualify for Fencing Summer Nationals? Here’s what you need to know. Changes this year The new qualification paths are similar to what they were before the pandemic, and it’s important to note that only points and ranking from the 2021-22 season will count towards qualification . Given the complexities of the last Fencing Summer Nationals, clarity on this point is not something that we take for granted. There are a few changes this year from the previous years in qualification. Almost all of them are reversions back to the way that qualification went before the pandemic. There have been major shifts in every single category from last year, meaning fencers should all go through their qualifications thoroughly!

The most significant change to the competition itself is that Y12 & Y14 will eliminate the bottom 20% after the pool round. This was challenging for youth fencers last year when there was a cut, and it will definitely be even more challenging this year, as that’s a higher percentage than previously, and this change will affect competition in July. Everything that you’ll find here is taken from the 2 021-2022 USA Fencing Handbook. Qualification paths for Fencing Summer Nationals 2022 There are different qualification paths for each individual category. Depending on a fencer’s age eligibility, they can qualify in multiple categories. There are 93 events in total this year! You’ll notice that there are both Fencing Summer Nationals and the July Challenge listed here. These competitions are run during the same weeklong event and in the same venue. The only real difference between them is the name and which events are included. The July Challenge is comprised of Cadet, Junior, Division 1, Senior Team, and Veteran Team events.

Fencing Summer Nationals is comprised of Y10, Y12, Y14, Division 1A, Division 2, Division 3, and individual Veteran events and the winner will have a title of the US National Champion in her/his age/weapon/gender category. There are a wide range of Veteran events embedded into the competition, including Veteran 40, Veteran 50, Veteran 60, Veteran 70, Veteran 80+. While we tend to think of youth fencers as being the central competitors in Fencing Summer Nationals, as you can see there are a wide range of Veteran competitions that go all the way up to age 80 and beyond. There is a longevity in competitive fencing, even at this high level, that is both fueling and inspiring. Though the fencing age requirements are fairly consistent across the board, they aren’t totally consistent for fencers who are eligible for the Junior Olympics. This is a nuance that’s worth checking with your coach about if you aren’t sure, though most fencers who are at that level have an idea of where they’re at.

This is especially true during the spring, as fencers start to need to do the math to figure out what they have to do to qualify. This time of year, we always have parents and fencers asking us about their qualification status for Fencing Summer Nationals.

It’s not a thing you’ll do just once and then have it figured out, either. Though the whole system is similar for every kind of fencer, it’s not exactly the same for each level. A Cadet and Y10 fencer will find familiarity in their qualification paths, but they will be different enough that they have to figure it out fresh for each of them. It’s not that difficult to figure out, so let’s jump in and walk through it! 1. How to Qualify for Summer Nationals THE thing to remember when looking towards qualification for Fencing Summer Nationals is that there are always multiple paths to get there. Every single fencer is able to qualify in multiple age divisions and through the Regional, Divisional, or National path. If a fencer is not quite there in one section, they should absolutely look to another section for the opportunity that will get them to Minneapolis!

For those who are new to the process – you might be closer than you think! Though many fencers trace qualification with their coach in detail from before the season even begins, that’s not the only way to go about it. If you have been competing without a plan up until now and aren’t sure where you stand, this is the time to figure it out! If you have been competing with a plan, again you are encouraged to look at a different path. Perhaps you thought that Regional Points was the way for you, but you’re not quite there. Look at the National pathway and see how close you are there. There are lots of possibilities, and it’s entirely reasonable to think that you’ve got opportunities you don’t see. To figure out what your possible paths are, please take a look at our previous blog post for a detailed description of the qualification guidelines.

If the written way isn’t easily clear to you, check out If you like a more visual presentation format, check out our comprehensive 2022 Summer Nationals Qualification Infographic . You’ll be able to directly follow through with your own path, based on your specific classification. Read the sections of Cadet, Junior, Division 1A, Division 2, Division 3 – these are the individual events you want to qualify for. We offer an updated infographic every year! For fencers who are old hat at this whole process, keep in mind that the broad strokes always stay the same, but that sometimes the specifics of qualification shift here and there. You’ll need to go through the qualification parameters every year to make sure you know where you are and where you have gaps or opportunities. There might be an easier path for you than what you are thinking of or one which might be a better fit.

How to verify individual point standing Regional and National points track the individual of each fencer towards the national championships. The one that we care about right now is the 2022 Summer Nationals held in Minneapolis, Minnesota on July 2-11, 2022. Fencers accumulate points at any number of competitive events across the country. These points are tallied along the way by USA Fencing, but it can be a little difficult to figure out how to find your own points in the milieu of numbers. All point standings, both regional and national, are publicly available, so you can see the points of every fencer who has earned any. Yes, you can see the points of your rivals as well as yourself. The full list can be found here , and once you’re there you can go in depth to find the standings of each individual fencer. For National Points, click on the list right/center with the gender and weapon categories.

Start off by making sure that the top portion is the current year – it’s a check box. Now go down the list for category, weapon, gender, region, and competition. Let’s walk through an example with Regional points. For instance, choose “Season” as 2021/22, “Age Group” as CDT (as in Cadet), “Gender” is Women, “Weapon” is Epee, “Region” is 4 (for example – AFM is in Region 4), and “Qualifying Tournament” should be 2022 USA Fencing National Championships and July Challenge.

If there are fewer points in both Cadet and Junior lists (you would need to repeat the same process again but choose Junior for “Age”) then you would need to see what additional chance to qualify your fencer has. We’ll detail that process below! This same process works for all fencers, regardless of age category, weapon, or gender. 3. Where to go to qualify for Summer Nationals Unfortunately, there are only a few opportunities left to qualify for the Summer Nationals. With spring already here, the timeline gets tight. Here, we’ve listed all of the final competitions that offer fencers the chance to qualify. Don’t miss them! Registration is still open and there is still an opportunity to make it to Summer Nationals! a) National Path – Participate in the April NAC The April NAC will feature Cadet, Junior, and Division 2 events.

The top 40% of competitors will earn national points in Cadet and Junior respectively, as well as Division 2 regional points. In both of these cases, the fencer will automatically qualify for their respective events. Not only is participation in NAC’s a fantastic opportunity to improve and get a great experience, but it’s also the only national points path that is left that allows fencers to automatically qualify for this year’s nationals and next year’s Junior Olympics. To sign up for April NAC (this is recommended regardless of the points! It’s a huge experience!) click here . Again, this is the LAST NAC of the season prior to there Summer Nationals. b) Regional Path Every region has its own regional competitions.

Depending on which region you’re in, there might be a whole lot of competitions for you still to qualify in. For example, Region 3 has eleven competitions still to go before the end of the season, where Region 2 only has three. You’ll see a list of all of the remaining regional competitions broken down by region a little further down, but let’s explain what you need to know first. Qualification is always about strategy, but it’s even moreso about that now that we are so far into the season. If there are multiple regional competitions that you can choose from, you want to think about who is going to be at that competition. For example, the regional qualifiers for Region 4 in Southern California are highly competitive as there are many highly competitive clubs in Southern California as well as in the San Francisco Bay Area who frequently travel south for the experience and competitions. They’re going to come out to those regional competitions in force for the Senior, Cadet, and Junior levels.

For some fencers, it would make a lot more sense to go to the qualifier in Utah than to those in SoCal because it will be less competitive and they will have a better chance to get those regional points. Similarly, this might be a situation in your region too, with one competition being significantly stronger than another and you might want to strategize where better to go based on your personal situation. For regional competitions, you are earning points towards your region only. There is a significant exception here – ROCs. A ROC is a Regional Open Circuit, and a fencer from any region can qualify for Summer Nationals. If you can find any ROC in any part of the country, sign up and compete. If you finish in top 40% – congratulations, you are qualified! As of this writing, there are ten ROCs left in the season. That’s ten opportunities to qualify for Fencing Summer Nationals!

You’ll find these on AskFred.net, and it’s also a place to be diligent about looking for open competitions. You should definitely ask your coach and your fellow fencers about potential divisional competitions that are coming your way.

{"id": "web-c395935d79-1", "text": " structured, particularly in regards to the geographic distribution of the tournaments around the country. Where and when major tournaments take place can have a significant impact on who can attend, which then has far reaching ramifications for how qualification plays out for individuals. For many fencers, the placement of national tournaments this season means that they’ll have to rethink what they’d like to attend to qualify. We wrote an in-depth piece about this when it was announced over the summer, and you can get all of the details there. The placement of national tournaments could be a challenge for those fencers who are accustomed to qualifying in a certain way. They might be frustrated that travel expenses are difficult to overcome, thanks to where those national tournaments are now. Rather than looking at this as a hindrance, fencers can view this as an opportunity to travel more or to challenge themselves to go the divisional or regional level to get the all way to the top. Now the big question is – how do fencers qualify for Fencing Summer Nationals? Here’s what you need to know.

Minimal changes This year, qualifying for the national tournament is almost identical to the qualification paths we saw last year. The only tweaks are that there are no Division 2 or Division 1A NACs, which means that this road to SN is unavailable in those sections. Basically, we’re having a second year of the same qualification path following the somewhat chaotic year that it all happened during the pandemic. Though there are not significant changes this year, that doesn’t mean that fencers should take their qualification path for granted. Though the path itself might not have changed, if you are switching from one level to another , that is a significant change for your personal road to qualification. It is incredibly important that fencers thoroughly understand how to get to SN now, rather than waiting until later in the season. The more you know, the better you can plan to maximize your time and resources. There’s no reason for you to extend yourself so far in order to make it to SN!

Qualification paths for Fencing Summer Nationals 2023 There are different qualification paths for each individual category. Depending on a fencer’s age eligibility, they can qualify in multiple categories. There are 93 events in total this year! You’ll notice that there are both Fencing Summer Nationals and the July Challenge listed here. These competitions are run during the same ten-day long tournament and in the same venue. The only real difference between them is the name and which events are included. The July Challenge is comprised of Cadet, Junior, Division 1, Senior Team, and Veteran Team events. Fencing Summer Nationals is comprised of Y10, Y12, Y14, Division 1A, Division 2, Division 3, and individual Veteran events.

While we tend to think of youth fencers as being the central competitors in Fencing Summer Nationals, as you can see there are a wide range of Veteran competitions that go all the way up to age 80 and beyond. There is a longevity in competitive fencing, even at this high level, that is both fueling and essentially growth driving. Though the fencing age requirements are fairly consistent across the board, they change for fencers who are eligible for the Junior Olympics. This is a nuance that’s worth checking with your coach about if you aren’t sure, though most fencers who are at that level have an idea of where they’re at.

Listing each of these individual competitions would take a huge amount of space and only apply to certain fencers. The national path, however, is open to everyone and is fairly concise. Don’t just try to make sense of this yourself – talk to your coach about what you need to do. This is the best way to know for sure where you stand!

Fencing competitions vary in size, location, type, qualification process, and more. While you don’t need to understand every little detail if you’re just getting started, it’s important to begin learning the terms and understanding the different types of competitions.

Note that USFA is continuously improving the way fencing competitions are run and the respective qualification paths. Therefore, keep in mind that the information presented is current at the time of writing, but the latest information is always available in the official USFA documentation (www.usfencing.org). National Fencing Championships Let’s start at the top! National championships are held once a year at three different levels: Division I, Junior Olympics (Juniors and Cadets), and Summer Nationals (all other divisions and age categories). They are only open to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. So if you’re new to fencing, you may soon be shooting for a Summer Nationals qualification! Summer Nationals are typically the end of June through the beginning of July and last for two weeks. Fencers qualify differently based on the age category: Y10 qualifies by being on either the national or regional Y10 point standings (must have earned either national or regional points through previous competitions).

Y14 qualifies by either (1) being on the Y14 national point standings, (2) being in the top 25% for Y14 regional points, (3) being in the top 16 of the Y12 national point standings, (4) being in the top eight of the Y12 regional point standings, or (5) placing in the top 25% in the Y14 Division qualifying competition for the current season. To summarize, Y10 and Y12 qualify through points and Y14 can qualify through points or by doing well enough in a qualifying competition. If you’re not yet familiar with national and regional points, look for an upcoming post! Also note that the above qualification paths were changed for the current season, and the changes are described in this blog post .

Also, we have posts that walk through an example for both Y12 and Y14 qualification paths based on these rules: Y12 qualification , Y14 qualification . North American Cups North American Cups (NACs) are a series of competitions held by US Fencing that provide an opportunity to gain national points. They cover all divisions and ages and each NAC focuses on a subset of categories. No qualification or U.S. citizenship is required, only eligibility by age and division. That means any fencer can participate if you’re willing to travel! Super Youth Circuit The Super Youth Circuit (SYC) consists of national events for all Youth fencers (Y10, Y12, and Y14). These events are held about once every month throughout the country. The SYC is one of the qualifying paths for the youth Summer Nationals. Regional Circuits Regional circuits are held multiple times a year, with frequency depending on your region and changing sometimes from year to year. They are held at three different levels similar to national championships: Seniors, Juniors and Cadets, and Youth. They are only open to U.S. citizens and permanent residents.

For those of you in the area or close by, these tournaments are a great opportunity to attend more competitions. They vary greatly in size and are hosted by local fencing clubs. If you’re in a different area, ask your club or Google options for additional local tournament opportunities! Open Fencing Competitions You can also find open competitions in your area in addition to the circuits and championships. Open competitions are held by divisional/regional committees or local clubs and can be sanctioned by USFA (meaning rankings can be earned with particular finishes). They are typically age-based rather than restricting based on ranking, so they can be a good opportunity for newer fencers to compete more often if they’re not yet ready for the circuit competitions.

Each time a fencer scores a touch, they receive a point. Points are received by making a touch in the opponent’s target area. Direct elimination matches in epee and foil consist of three three‐minute periods with a one‐minute break between each. In saber, the first period lasts for eight touches, and the second period ends when the first fencer scores 15 points. *Note: Some classifications of fencing, such as certain youth classifications and Veteran (age 40 and up), fence 10-touch bouts. In these, there are two periods instead of three.

(Photo by USA Fencing) Following the Action The fencer being attacked defends by use of a \"parry\" — a motion used to deflect the opponent’s blade, after which the defender can make a \"riposte,\" or an answering attack. Whenever a hit is made, the referee will stop the bout, describe the action, and decide whether to award a touch. Fencers seek to maintain a safe distance from each other — that is, they try to stay out of the range of the opponent’s attack. Then, one will try to break this distance to gain the advantage for an attack. At times, a fencer will make a false attack to gauge the types of reactions of their opponent. When a fencer lands a hit, the referee stops the bout and — in foil and saber — determines who was the attacker, whether their opponent successfully defended themselves, and which fencer should be awarded a touch, if any. The referee always clearly raises their hand on the side of the fencer for whom they have awarded a point.

Watching these hand signals can make it easier for newcomers to follow the momentum of a fencing bout without understanding every rule. (Photo by USA Fencing) Right‐Of‐Way One of the trickier rules to learn in fencing is \"right-of-way.\" But, like the other rules of fencing, you'll start to understand it more as you practice with your coach and teammates. Right-of-way is a rule in fencing designed to determine who gets the point when both fencers hit at the same time. Important note: this rule is applied only in foil and saber fencing, not in epee. So what happens when both the red and green lights on the scoring box light up simultaneously? The referee steps in to decide who had the right-of-way, essentially determining who \"owns\" the attack. Why Do We Need It? # The right-of-way rule exists to eliminate confusion when two fencers attack each other at the same time.

Sounds simple, right? But, here's where things get interesting. Defense and Taking Over Right-of-Way # If you're on the receiving end of an attack, you have options! You can either defend yourself with a \"parry,\" which is a defensive move that blocks your opponent's weapon, or make your opponent miss their attack. Successfully doing so allows you to \"take over\" the right-of-way and make your own attack to score a point. Hesitation Is Your Enemy # In fencing, hesitation could cost you. If a fencer hesitates too long while advancing, they give up the right-of-way to their opponent. Referees are particularly strict about this in saber bouts, where you might see a fencer execute a \"stop cut\" against an opponent who hesitates, thereby winning both the right-of-way and the point.

The fencers walk on piste fully dressed, aside from the mask. If necessary, they plug their body wires into the spools connected to the electronic scoring apparatus and test their weapons against each other, to make sure everything is functioning. They then retreat to their en-garde lines. Prior to starting a bout, the fencers must salute each other. Refusal to do so can result in a fencer's suspension or disqualification. Both fencers must salute each other and the referee. They may choose to salute the audience. In non-electric events the four judges should also be saluted.

Various apocryphal stories about the origin of the salute circulate, like gladiators saluting each other in the arena, crusaders pointing their sword heavenward in pre-battle prayer, duellists showing each other that their swords are the same length, etc. The most likely source of the modern fencing salute is the \" Present arms \" command from military drill , which originated in the 16th century.

The use of \"fence\" is contrary to the rules in certain countries [ citation needed ] .) This is the start of a phrase i.e. an any unbroken chain of recognizable offensive and defensive actions, such as lunging or parrying performed by the two fencers.

Once the bout is stopped, the referee will, if necessary, explain their reasons for stopping it, analyze what has just happened and award points or give out penalties. If a point has been awarded, then the competitors return to their en-garde lines; if not, they remain approximately where they were when the bout was interrupted. The referee will then restart the bout as before. If the fencers were within lunging distance when the bout was interrupted and they are not required to return to their en-garde lines, the referee will ask both fencers to give sufficient ground to ensure a fair start.

If a fencer needs to stop the bout to adjust their mask or tie their shoe, or something else requires the referee's attention, they may do so by tapping their back foot and/or waving their back hand and the referee will generally call a halt. Tapping the front foot is called an appel and is actually a tactical move, intended to distract the opposing fencer; thus, the referee may ignore a front-foot tap. This procedure is repeated until either one of the fencers has reached the required number of points (generally, 1, 5, or 15, depending on the format of the bout) or until the time allowed for the bout runs out. Fencing bouts are timed: the clock is started every time the referee calls \"Allez\" and stopped every time they call \"Halt!\".

If a point is scored, then that fencer wins, however if no points are scored then the fencer with priority wins.

Since July 1, 2020 (and reconfirmed by FIE public notice in September 2020 and in January 2021), by public written notice the FIE had replaced its previous handshake requirement with a \"salute\" by the opposing fencers, and written in its public notice that handshakes were \"suspended until further notice.\" [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] After the Olga Kharlan handshaking incident in 2023, the International Fencing Federation changed its rules so that the previously required handshakes between fencers at the end of a bout would become optional, with a distance greeting permitted instead.

When both fencers hit more or less simultaneously, only the fencer who had priority receives the point. If priority cannot be assigned unambiguously, no points are awarded. These rules were adopted in the 18th century as part of teaching practice. Their aim is to encourage \"sensible\" fencing and reward initiative and circumspection at the same time, in particular, to reward fencers for properly made attacks, and penalize fencers for attacking into such an attack that lands, an action that could be lethal with sharp blades. The risk of both duelists charging onto one another's swords is kept to a minimum.

Scoring [ edit ] Non-electronic scoring [ edit ] Prior to the introduction of electronic scoring equipment, the president of jury was assisted by four judges. Two judges were positioned behind each fencer, one on each side of the strip. The judges watched the fencer opposite to see if he was hit. This system is sometimes called \"dry\" fencing (USA) or \"steam\" (United Kingdom, Australia) fencing. When any of the judges thinks they saw a hit, that judge raises their hand. The president ( referee or director ) then stops the bout and reviews the relevant phases of the action, polling the judges at each stage to determine whether there was a touch, and (in foil and sabre) whether the touch was valid or invalid. The judges answer \"Yes\", \"Yes, but off-target\" (in foil and sabre), \"No\", or \"Abstain\". Each judge has one vote, and the president has one and a half votes.

Thus, two judges could overrule the president; but if the judges disagreed, or if one judge abstained, the president's opinion rules. Épée fencing was later [ timeframe? ] conducted with red dye on the tip, easily seen on the white uniform. As a bout went on, if a touch was seen, a red mark would appear. Between the halts of the director, judges would inspect each fencer for any red marks. Once one was found, it was circled in a dark pencil to show that it had already been counted. The red dye was not easily removed, preventing any cheating . The only way to remove it was through certain acids such as vinegar . Non-electronic scoring methods were plagued by uncertain rulings, due to the small points of the weapons, the speed at which the sport was played, and obscuring movements from the fencers.

Even in the best of circumstances, it was very difficult to accurately score hits, and it systematically under-reported valid touches to hard-to-see areas, such as the back or flank under the arm. Electronic scoring [ edit ] Electronic scoring is used in all major national and international, and most local, competitions. At Olympic level, it was first introduced to épée in 1936, to foil in 1956, and to sabre in 1988. The central component of the scoring system is commonly known as \"the box\". In the simplest version both fencers' weapons are connected to the box via long retractable cables. The box normally carries a set of lights to signal when a touch has been made. (Larger peripheral lights are also often used.) In foil and sabre, because of the need to distinguish on-target hits from off-target ones, special conductive clothing and wires must be worn.

Recently, [ timeframe? ] reel-less gear has been adopted for all weapons at top competitions. In this system, which eliminates the spool (by using the fencer's own body as a grounding point), the lights and detectors are mounted directly on the fencers' masks. For the sake of the audience, clearly visible peripheral lights triggered by wireless transmission may be used. However, the mask lights must remain as the official indicators because FIE regulations prohibit the use of wireless transmitters in official scoring equipment in order to prevent cheating.

The first international competitions to use the reel-less versions of these weapons were held in 2006. [ 13 ] In the case of foil and épée, hits are registered by depressing a small push-button on the end of the blade. In foil, the hit must land on the opponent's lame to be considered on-target. (On-target hits set off coloured lights; off-target hits set off white lights.) At high level foil and épée competitions, grounded conductive pistes are normally laid down to ensure that bouts are not disrupted by accidental hits on the floor. In sabre, an on-target hit is registered whenever a fencer's blade comes into contact with the opponent's lamé jacket, cuff or mask. Off-target hits are not registered at all in sabre. It has been proposed that a similar arrangement (non-registration of off-target hits) be adopted for foil. This proposal is due to be reviewed at the 2007 FIE Congress.

In foil and sabre, despite the presence of all the gadgetry, it is still the referee's job to analyze the phrase and, in the case of simultaneous hits, to determine which fencer had the right of way. Criticism of electronic scoring [ edit ] One of the most common criticisms of electronic scoring has been the registration of glancing hits in foil. Traditionally, a valid, \"palpable\" hit could only be scored, if the point were fixed on the target in such a manner, as would be likely to pierce the skin, had the weapon been sharp. However, the electric foil point (the push-button on the end of the blade) lacks directionality, so hits which arrive at a very high angle of incidence can still register.

Flicking [ edit ] In the 1980s, this led to a growing popularity of hits delivered with a whip-like action (commonly known as \"the flick \"), bending the blade around the opponent's parry. Many [ who? ] saw this as an unacceptable deviation from tradition. In fact, the disputes over the flick grew so bitter that a number of traditionalists advocated (and still continue to advocate) complete abandonment of electronic scoring as something detrimental to fencing as an art. Timing changes [ edit ] In 2004-2005 the FIE brought in rule changes to address concerns over flicking. The dwell time (the length of time the point has to remain depressed in order to register a hit) was increased from 1 millisecond to 15 milliseconds. While this did not eliminate the flick altogether, it made it technically trickier thereby denting its popularity. [ citation needed ] However, there have been issues with apparently \"palpable\" hits not registering.

The issue of unwillingness to attack was addressed by the FIE with the “Unwillingness to Fight” rule in 2019, which implemented penalties for inactivity and was first used at the Olympics during the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. This Unwillingness to Fight rule dictated that when a minute elapses without a point, the fencer who is behind receives a yellow card, and multiple offenses would warrant a red card.

The other serious problem in sabre is that of \"whip-over.\" The flexibility of the blades is such that the momentum of a cut can often \"whip\" the end of the blade around the defender's parry. The low success rate of parries (compared to other weapons) is seen by many [ who? ] as impoverishing the tactical repertory of the weapon.

There has been talk of making the sabre guard smaller, in order to make attacks on preparation and counterattacks easier and thus slow down the momentum of the attack, giving the defender more of a chance. [ citation needed ] The cutout time is the maximum time allowed by the box between two hits registering as simultaneous (if this time is exceeded, only one light will appear). In épée this time is very short: 40 milliseconds. This means that, so far as human perception is concerned, the hits really do need to arrive at the same instant. In foil and sabre, where priority rules apply, the cutout times are considerably longer (hundreds of milliseconds).

It is possible to execute a long marching attack with only a hint of an arm extension, clearly inviting an attack on preparation, which is then followed by a delayed trompment. For those reasons, in 2004-2005 the FIE slashed the cut-out times for foil and sabre from 750 milliseconds to 350 milliseconds and from 350 milliseconds to 120 milliseconds respectively. In 2016 the lockout timing for sabre was again modified to increase the lockout time from 120 milliseconds to 170 milliseconds +/- 10ms, while the foil and épée lockout times remained unchanged. Techniques [ edit ] Main articles: Fencing tactics and Footwork (martial arts) Bladework [ edit ] The nine classical parries comprise basic bladework. The first parry that most fencers learn is quarte , known commonly as \"parry four\". Parries are named for the line that they defend from attack: parry four would defend line four, which is the high inside line. Offensive bladework consists of the various means of scoring a touch on an opponent. The straight attack is a direct extension towards valid target.

The straight attack is a direct extension towards valid target. As it is easily defended against, fencers often use numerous feints to deceive their opponent into parrying and then disengage around the blade. As a preparation for an attack, fencers may execute a prise de fer , or attack on the blade. This includes the simple beat , a sharp rap on the opponent's blade, and the more complex bind , in which the fencer forces the opponent's blade to a different line. Footwork [ edit ] The lunge position on the right, showing how much more distance can be obtained over the en garde stance In a fencing bout, a great deal depends on being in the right place at the right time. Fencers are constantly maneuvering in and out of each other's range, accelerating, decelerating, changing directions and so on. All this has to be done with minimum effort and maximum grace, which makes footwork arguably the most important aspect of a fencer's training regimen.

In contemporary sport fencing defense by footwork usually takes the shape of moving either directly away from your opponent or directly towards them. The most common way of delivering an attack in fencing is the lunge , where the fencer reaches out with their front foot and straightens their back leg. This maneuver has the advantage of allowing the fencer to maintain balance while covering far more distance than in a single step, yet allowing a return to the defensive stance. Competition [ edit ] Fencing tournaments are varied in their format, and there are both individual and team competitions. A tournament may comprise all three weapons, both individual and team, or it may be more specific, such as an Épée Challenge, with individual épée only. As in many sports, men and women compete separately. Individual events [ edit ] Generally, an individual event consists of two parts: the pools, and the direct eliminations. In the pools, fencers are divided into groups, and every fencer in a pool will have the chance to fence every other fencer once. The size and number of the pools is determined by the number of athletes who have regist", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_rules", "title": "Fencing rules - Wikipedia", "tags": [], "date": ""}

The size and number of the pools is determined by the number of athletes who have registered for the competition. Pool bouts are three minutes long, and are fenced to five points. If no fencer reaches five points, then the one with the most points after three minutes wins. Pool results are recorded on a scoresheet, which must be signed by the fencers after their last match. The referee will write down how many points each fencer scored in the bout, although normally if a fencer won with five points a \"V\" (for victoire ) is written down instead of a 5. Losing a pool match does not eliminate a fencer from the tournament. In some tournaments, there are two rounds of pools, with the second round following the same format, but with pools of different fencers. After the pools are finished, the direct elimination round starts. Fencers are sorted in a table of some power of 2 (16, 32, 64, etc.) based on how many people are competing. There are rarely exactly the right number of people for this to work out perfectly, so the lowest ranking fencers may be eliminated, or they may be included in the next", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_rules", "title": "Fencing rules - Wikipedia", "tags": [], "date": ""}

There are rarely exactly the right number of people for this to work out perfectly, so the lowest ranking fencers may be eliminated, or they may be included in the next highest power of 2 with the top fencers receiving a bye . Once the table size has been chosen, fencers are slotted into the table like this: first place vs. last place, second vs. second last, third vs. third last etc. A fencers place is decided by three factors: their victories divided by matches fenced, their indicator score, which is calculated by the numbers of hits for and against during the pool rounds, and finally their hits scored. If there is no way of separating the fencers beyond these three indicators, then they are considered equal and draw random lots for their place in the table. The elimination round matches in foil and épée are fenced in three periods of three minutes each. In between each period, there is a one-minute break. Sabre matches are so much faster that the three-minute mark is almost never reached. Therefore, in sabre, when one fencer reaches 8 points, there is a one-minute break. In all three weapons, the match goes until 15 points.

Fencing is slightly unusual in that no one has to fence for third place. Instead, two bronze medals are given to the losers of the semi-final round. The exception to this is team events at international level, and individual events at the Olympic Games where a 3rd place play-off must be fenced. Team events [ edit ] Team competition involves teams of three fencers. A fourth fencer can be allowed on the team as an alternate, but as soon as the fourth has been subbed in, they cannot leave again. The opposing team must be alerted of this substitution at least one round before it happens. The modern team competition is similar to the pool round of the individual competition.

Teams are not aware of the order their opponents will be fencing in, although the sheet is designed so that no two athletes will fence each other twice. Matches between teams are three minutes long, or to 5 points, as in the pools. There are important differences, however: each match the score carries over, and the maximum score for each match is increased by 5. The maximum score for each round continues increasing by 5 regardless of how many points were scored in the previous match. Because there are 9 matches, the highest score possible is 45 points. While sabre almost inevitably goes to 45, it is not unusual to see an épée score in the mid to low thirties.

Unlike individual tournaments, teams must almost always fence for bronze. There is also an older team format, no longer in popular use. Under these rules, the teams were still three members each, and still consisted of nine matches round-robin tournament style. However, scores did not carry over. The team to first win 5 matches (a majority) was declared the winner.

One important part of the competition is penalties. As parents, we want to understand why our child is being penalized if it happens, and we also want to be able to talk them through it if it upsets them. This post will explain the basics of the different types of fencing penalties, why they are given, and what happens if your child gets a penalty card.

The current US Fencing rulebook is 200 pages long, and who can be expected to learn all of that material right off the bat? Some things just have to be learned as you go. It’s not uncommon for a younger fencer to receive a penalty and not understand why or to not know how to avoid getting one. In the event of a penalty, remind your child that it happens to many fencers and it’s not a big deal—just a learning opportunity. The first thing to know is that the USFA provides a convenient penalty chart . While it’s only two pages long, it’s still a lot of information. However, in my experience, inexperienced fencers tend to make similar mistakes, so we can start with a smaller subset of penalties and cover most situations. The other good news is that most of these “newbie” mistakes are easy to avoid and you can talk your child through them ahead of time to prevent penalties.

Red cards give the opponent a touch. In the worst cases, with repeated offenses or very bad sportsmanship, black cards can be given, which means expulsion from the competition. Here is a list of tips for younger fencers and new parents to stay on the right side of the rules. Always take two weapons, two body cords, and two mask cords (for sabre and foil) to any competition. While at the competition, bring both sets of equipment to the strip. Having a spare set in your fencing bag on the other side of the venue won’t do you any good once you’re competing—the delay caused by retrieving it will lead to a yellow card. Never touch the reel cord, the connected body card, or the socket. Children sometimes find comfort in keeping their unarmed hand on the connector. These actions can cause equipment malfunctions and lead to yellow cards. Always check your weapons before a competition, and before each bout once you are there. To avoid yellow cards, look for missing screws on epees and malfunctioning body cords (i.e., showing off-target for foil whe", "source": "https://academyoffencingmasters.com/blog/fencing-penalties-101-parents/", "title": "Fencing Penalties 101 for Parents - Academy of Fencing Masters", "tags": [], "date": ""}

To avoid yellow cards, look for missing screws on epees and malfunctioning body cords (i.e., showing off-target for foil when wiggling). Never straighten your weapon on the strip! Always ask the referee’s permission to straighten your weapon if needed, and if granted, go off strip to straighten it . Straightening on the strip will lead to a yellow card. Similar to not straightening on strip, never drag your weapon on the strip. Younger fencers often drag their weapon, especially when returning to the en garde line if they’re disappointed because they just lost a point. This might be a yellow card offense, and although it’s not strictly enforced, I have seen it recently after a referee warned a fencer not to do that. It’s important to learn proper etiquette regardless, and learning this early will avoid penalties now and later. During Direct Elimination, fencers must stay on the strip and connected during the one-minute breaks.

Leaving when you aren’t supposed to can lead to a yellow card. In larger regional and national events, equipment is often checked and has to pass inspection to be used during the competition. Equipment that passes receives an identifying mark, and this is the ONLY equipment you can use that day. Never grab a spare cord or glove that hasn’t been stamped. This is an automatic red card. It’s a great idea to go over this list with your fencer. I suggest not overemphasizing that penalties are “bad,” but rather a part of the game that you want to avoid. Chances are mistakes will be made and your child might receive a card depending on the referee. You don’t want to encourage them to get overly upset in this situation because it can affect their performance going forward and lead to a bigger punishment than the card if it causes them to lose the bout. ← Fencing Referees and Bad Calls: What to do when you know the call is wrong Newly Established AFM Y8 Fencing Tournament → 6 Comments 408fencer on March 31, 2015 at 12:53 pm While avo", "source": "https://academyoffencingmasters.com/blog/fencing-penalties-101-parents/", "title": "Fencing Penalties 101 for Parents - Academy of Fencing Masters", "tags": [], "date": ""}

However if the ref has already told the fencer not to do it, then if it happens again the ref could card using the generic “refusal to obey the referee” penalty. Reply Igor Chirashnya on March 31, 2015 at 1:08 pm Well, the rule t.46.2; t.61.2 says it, and one of our fencers was actually penalized for that as well (I am not sure however whether she was warned before for the same thing). The major rule of thumb in my opinion is better be safe than sorry. No point to drag your weapon in frustration from many reasons, including you risk to get carded.

Reply L Mao on March 31, 2015 at 1:51 pm There certainly are a lot of rules. Fortunately for us parents, refs at local tournaments tend to treat enforcement as a teachable moment. This leads to kids learning the rules on their own just by virtue of attending competitions. I can tell you for a fact that my kid has never read the rulebook, but he knows all the rules you mentioned and more. Particularly the ones he has been carded for not obeying (mostly covering and turning around before halt is called). Rule #6 above actually came up at a recent competition.

Guess I just thought it meant you couldn’t unhook and leave the strip. There is always more to learn. Reply Igor Chirashnya on March 31, 2015 at 2:04 pm He certainly will remember every rule that involved him being carded! At last Summer Nationals Adam went to the restrooms and the tape from the cord went off, so he was red carded for using not checked equipment. Now at every RYC he checks whether his cord still has the tape. Cannot beat a personal experience.

This concept and the understanding of it are key to making sense of fencing, no matter if you are a fencer, a coach, a parent, a referee, or a fan. This post is long. It’s long enough that we’ve broken it up into sections to help make it easier to follow. This is a mega post, so get comfortable, or better yet – bookmark this post so you can come back to it! First, we’ll break down a new way of seeing priority. Then we’ll go through a dozen detailed examples to go even further and let you really get a deep understanding of what it’s all about.

Coming at the concept from different angles is so important! During a match, one that’s going quick as lightning already, it’s almost impossible to understand for non-fencers why the touch was not awarded. Even more difficult to understand is why the decision not to award the touch was the right one. Before we go any further – priority and right of way are the same. They’re synonyms, and you’ll see them used as synonyms here and in the real world of fencing. You have “right of way” or you get priority. Same thing. For a lot of people, the whole thing is so confusing, so unclear. This goes especially for newbies in fencing and for parents. It’s not just parents and fencing fans who don’t get it, epee fencers often don’t understand right of way if they didn’t start out with foil before they take on epee! Though they may have a cursory understanding of the concept, they usually don’t really get it.

They might have an idea that they know that one action precedes the other, and obviously they can see parries and riposts, but often they cannot decipher complex foil or saber phrases. The thing is, learning right of way is something that you have to do intentionally. You’re not just going to pick it up by kind of half looking at foil and saber matches. The best way to really learn right of way is to fence it, but naturally that’s not really possible for parents or epee fencers or fans of the sport. That’s why we’re sharing with you a detailed understanding of right of way in fencing, and hopefully by the end of this article you’ll get that wonderful “click” in your brain that we all want to have! Here, I’m going to break it down in a simple way that makes sense for non-fencers. The most important point is that this post is not explaining the rules or redefining the rules .

Enough that you will be able to see the phrase on Youtube matches and decipher it quite accurately, particularly if you have some training. Part 1 – Understanding Priority For foil or sabre fences, referees and coaches, this is the kind of language that we speak. It’s not a language like other languages though, not like learning English or Chinese or Russian. It’s not even a language like math or the language of science. We almost never learn through the language of theory, through talking about it. It’s not practical, and it’s not easy. Right of way is mostly learned through a step-by-step, kinesthetic process. Kinesthetic learning is learning through the body. For most of us, it is a way to hardwire our understanding. In fencing, it has everything to do with the doing. The body learns it, not the mind so much. I would tend to say that it’s very much how babies learn grammar and language from us. It’s not that mom and dad sit down with a grammar book and go through how to structure a sentence with a twelve month old child. You don’t explain to your baby very complex grammar rules.

You talk to them in very simple language, and initially it’s all very concrete. The same with foil and saber fencing. A beginner fencer starts with very simple phrases, very simple concepts, then as they progress to a more complex understanding they continue to build on that foundation. At some point, you are able to say “I speak this language fluently,” but true mastery comes with years and years of time. There is always some new phrase or word to learn even then – there is no such thing as knowing everything there is to know. It’s evolving all of the time. The same thing happens with right of way learning – it’s an evolving thing. No matter how fluent you are in fencing and the rules, there is always a fluidity and an interpretation to learn. Of course, right of way is not as complex as language, but it’s a good way to look at it.

{"id": "web-e304b5d444-6", "text": "y 3 major reasons why right of way is such a complex concept. Reason #1 – Focus on a clean action The rules focus on a clean action, which is the final one. The problem with that is that it is easy to understand this idea in a fencing demo when two partners do the action in relatively slow motion, but once we transpose it to a real fencing bout it tends to look totally different. The exact same actions look totally different! The reason for that? Everything changes – the speed of movement, the distance between opponents, the viewing angle (sometimes totally blocking the view), the cleaness of the action (a nice and clear parry in a demo versus just a slight touch on a blade in a bout), and of course the timing of actions. In a demo, an attacker visibly starts first and a defender visibly delays his or her response. Reason #2 – Focus on discrete action Even more than that – it is almost never a single discrete action. A real fencing bout consists of hundreds of actions. These actions can change very fast from one to another without scoring. They change from offence to defence and back, sometimes simultaneously. There might be multiple actions that precede the final touch.

There might be multiple actions that precede the final touch. For the “uninitiated” observer, all these actions look like a cacophony of clashing metal. Many have a difficult time really separating the dozens of actions that happen in a few seconds. Reason #3 – Difficult language Another problem with official fencing rules is that they are written in a bit of a complicated way. When I read them, I feel like I am reading a kind of ‘archaic’ manual. It takes me more than my usual amount of focus to go through the rules. In some cases, I think that I understand the text because I know the rule, and not I understand the rule because I understand the text… Yes, the truth is that it is a complicated concept and describing the rules in a fully comprehensive way that covers 100% of all possible situations is challenging, to say the least.

I like breaking things down into smaller parts. Big concepts become digestible. This explanation doesn’t replace rule books and it certainly does not replace your conversations with coaches, fellow fencers or referees. My only purpose is to help “uninitiated” people to get a better understanding of the right of way rules, especially in more complex situations when the priority is transferred from one fencer to another in the sequence of just a few actions that happen so fast that it is easy to miss everything.

To publish this post, knowing that fencing coaches, referees and experienced fencers will immediately jump in to criticize my definition and explanation, I did a mental exercise deliberately applying this definition to each and every technical rule in the fencing rulebook ( FIE Technical Rules from December 2019, rules t.83-89). Almost all rules can be explained and viewed directly using this definition, as I show through numerous examples in part two of this post. There is one exception that I did not find a good way to describe using my method, and it is a stop-hit on a compound attack, rule t.88. Even if I miss some situation in either explanation and examples, and you or your coach find a hole explaining it using my definition, I want you to let me know about this situation so I will be able to re-examine it.

If there is a hole indeed and my definition does not sufficiently explain this situation, then I would say that this is as with any rule – an exception. This way of explaining the priority will teach you to look differently at foil and sabre fencing. If you understand the phrase, even if you make some misjudgements first, you will learn the principle. You may think that some rules explained by this definition are a bit too “stretchy”, and that’s exactly the goal. That means that you really learned the concept. The best way to view this post is not as an explanation or definition of the rules, but as a learning tool to be able to follow and understand the action and calls in foil and sabre, fencing weapons of right of way. Again, to emphasize my goal here – I want to find a way to help right of way be clear to people who have no clue about fencing.

It’s not the explanation that you’ll find anywhere else because actually this is a SINGLE concept versus many different rules. Again, it is ABSOLUTELY different from anything you have heard from your coaches or referees. It is intentionally so, not to confuse you with the rules, but to see how you can look at the rules and the situation differently and decipher complex phrases to easy ones and thus understand them. One paragraph that explains the whole Right of Way concept: “A fencer who first starts an attack gets a priority. Priority transfers from one fencer to another as they attempt to hit each other.

What follows below is how you can apply this single simple lense to every situation in fencing and understand the right of way. Every word has meaning. We will explain each word and its importance below. What do each of these parts mean? Let’s start with a simple thing, the definition. We are going to then break it down in detail, allowing you to get as clear an understanding as possible. Attacks and Defences First of all – let’s define two simple but central concepts: attack and defence, and the most important concept of the Right of Way explanation – the certain part of it. I have intentionally simplified these ideas to bring them to an intuitive level. Attack – an offensive, intentional attempt to score a touch. It typically results either in a touch landed on an opponent, a touch blocked by an opponent, or a touch missed. Defense – an intentional attempt to avoid being hit by the attacker. Let’s go a bit further and introduce a new concept – a certain action and its opposite, an uncertain action.

By certain action (being it offensive or defensive action), I mean an action that “guarantees” its success as intended. Let’s explain and also exaggerate a bit. We’ll start with defense. Certain defense is when a defender makes a certain attempt to deflect the blade by parrying or blocking it – this means the defender “knows” that the attacker’s blow is blocked. An uncertain defense is when the defender does not attempt to deflect the blade and tries to precede being hit by a faster and earlier counter attack, or by trying to avoid a touch with a body movement (e.g., ducking or twisting sidewise). They are mostly relying on luck to not be hit rather on a clear intention of avoiding the touch. So “certain” defence means that the defender really created a situation that, when executed correctly and fully, the defender would not be hit. So “a parry”, “a point in line” and “opponent beat the strong part of the blade” would be active defenses (last two will be examined in the examples in Part 2). Any type of counter-attack or body twisting will not be. However, if a defender did not succeed to execute ", "source": "https://academyoffencingmasters.com/blog/a-dummys-guide-to-right-of-way-or-priority-in-fencing/", "title": "A Dummy’s Guide to Right of Way or Priority in Fencing - Academy of Fencing Masters", "tags": [], "date": ""}

However, if a defender did not succeed to execute the active defence correctly and fully, situations might arise such as the arm bent in “point in line”, or “parry in the same line of attack”, or “malparry”. We will get to these situations later and clearly explain them. What composes a defense? There are three basic defense actions: Parry Point-in-Line Counter-attack The first 2 are very certain defences. When executed correctly, I know that I can successfully prevent an opponent’s hit. However, the counter-attack is not a certain defence. I cannot guarantee that I will not be hit by trying to be faster or twisting my body and not actively blocking and deflecting my opponent’s blade. Let’s repeat, defence is “certain” when I “guarantee” to avoid being hit by my defensive action, and defence is “uncertain” when I rely on luck to not be hit. What is a certain attack in my definition? An attack is certain when the attacker attempts to score and the defender does not destroy it with his/her certain defence. In other words, when the opponent’s blade is not a", "source": "https://academyoffencingmasters.com/blog/a-dummys-guide-to-right-of-way-or-priority-in-fencing/", "title": "A Dummy’s Guide to Right of Way or Priority in Fencing - Academy of Fencing Masters", "tags": [], "date": ""}
{"id": "web-e304b5d444-15", "text": "tion? An attack is certain when the attacker attempts to score and the defender does not destroy it with his/her certain defence. In other words, when the opponent’s blade is not a real threat. When is a defender’s blade a real threat? Well, now it is easy. If my opponent executes a parry on an attack, has a fully extended arm (point-in-line) before I start to execute my attack, or successfully avoids his/her blade to be taken hold of or been beat – all this means it is a “suicidal” mission to continue because of imminent threat of the defender’s blade! So certain defence destroys uncertain attack, while certain attack penetrates uncertain defence. Think about priority in the following way: in old times, when you called your opponent an enemy, didn’t have a safe fencing protective gear, were dueling with sharp and cutting weapons, you would commit to an action only when it was a certain bet.

Actions and Phrases The other concept that is central here is the idea of an action or a phrase . Here we use the term “phrase” and not “fencing phrase” only for the sake of brevity. This is the concept that is most challenging to delineate, so this section is detailed! An action is a series of fencing movements that start with the intent of the fencer to score and it does not stop until the attempt of a touch and is not interrupted by an opponent. If a fencer attacks, the action is from the moment a fencer intends to attack till the moment when they complete an attempt to score or are stopped. The point is to attempt to score. Sometimes, when a fencer attempts to score, they miss and pull the touch. If the fencer misses, then that’s the end of the action. If the fencer completes the touch, then that’s the end of the action. If the fencer is stopped or stops by herself, then that’s the end of the action. If a fencer took a parry, the action is from the moment she took the parry till she attempted to hit in a ripost.

A phrase is a series of closely connected in time actions which starts with one fencer’s intent to score and finishes either when a touch or hit is made or missed, the action is stopped or interrupted. Some call it a conversation between the fencers or exchange of the actions from one fencer attacking and another defending. This is essential to understand. The action is from the moment of initiation to the attempt. The moment of initiation can well be the moment of last interruption, and the initiation can be performed by both or one of the opponents. There can be many consecutive actions or phrases . For example, the fencer may attempt to score, they may miss and try again. Let’s say it’s an attacking action, and the fencer attacks and misses. Then she realizes she missed and attempt to attack again. Those are two actions – one is the attack missed and the second that will start the moment that she realized she missed and choose to continue and score is a second action. It’s called remise and it composes one phrase – attack/no hit, remise/touch.

Another example of the phrase is when one fencer attempts to attack, beats the blade and lunges, the opponent steps back, takes a parry and lunges with the final touch. There were two actions – attack with the beat is one, and parry/riposte the second. The phrase will be attack/parry-riposte. Phrases can be even more complicated. They can be composed of multiple actions , as long as they “belong” to the same initial intent and reaction. For example, if Fencer A attacks, Fencer B might parry and attempt to riposte, however the first fencer succeeds to recover from the failed attack and blocks the touch by counter-parry, tries to score again but misses, and the Fencer B then succeeds in scoring a touch. This is quite a complicated phrase that involves many actions, namely: attack, parry-riposte, counter-parry with no hit, and remise.

This phrase was initiated by Fencer A and resulted in Fencer B succeeding to score a touch.

For example, let’s say Fencer A initiates an attack, but does not score and does not get hit, and then retreats a few steps out of danger. A few seconds later there is another attempt to score by one of the fencers. These are considered two separate phrases . The first one is not interesting anymore in any regard to how the second phrase will be interpreted. These two phrases are not close in time and not a result of the same initial action intent.

Their meaning is quite straightforward: Uninterrupted means that the opponent did not succeed to perform any “certain” defensive action to interrupt the certain offensive action, and vise versa – the opponent did not succeed to perform any “certain” offensive action to interrupt the certain defensive action. Continuous means that the action is immediate and seamless. For example, if I take a parry, I immediately ripost in a single continuous movement. If I attack, I don’t stop. Like in music, the notes are continuously connected and played without a pause between them. So let’s repeat the definition: “A fencer who first starts an attack gets a priority. Priority transfers from one fencer to another as they attempt to hit each other. The last certain, uninterrupted, and continuous action gets the final priority ” It is easy to understand now.

This is truly the best way to get a deeper understanding and to internalize the concept. We’ve already established that fencers learn about right of way by doing it, and unfortunately that’s not an option for you if you are a parent or a novice fencer! There are several examples that follow, starting slowly and growing in complexity as you keep reading. Walking through examples is in the same vein as practice, the closest we can get anyway, so let’s jump in. Right of way example 1 Fencer A initiates an attack against Fencer B. Fencer B counterattacks. Both fencers light up. How does the referee determine priority? Fencer A initiated the attack so he was the first to start. From the beginning of the exchange, there was a continuous action. Fencer B resorted to “uncertain” defence which did not interrupt the attack. He did not try to parry or block the attacker’s blade, instead he relied on his luck with a counter-attack. The phrase is: attack from A, counter-attack from B. A wins priority.

Referee will decide on either award A the point, if colored light for A, or consider this hit attack off-target in foil, if the light of A is white, regardless of the light for B. In the rest of the examples we will skip this long description of lights, as it is always like this. Right of way example 2 Fencer A attacks without any action on an opponent’s blade and before she scores, Fencer B makes a parry and now both hit. Both lights are on, whether it’s a colored light or a white light. Fencer A attacked, but unlike the first example, this time Fencer B did interrupt the continuous action with “certain” defense, which is a parry. This is a moment the new action starts, which is parry-riposte and the priority is transferred from A to B. Since there was a hit in that action, this is the last action. Fencer B gets a priority because in this case she had chosen to go for a certain defense, and her opponent did not interrupt her. The action that meets the definition of right of way is of Fencer B.

However, this time when Fencer A felt that Fencer B took the parry, instead of continuing she took the counterparry and hit only after that. Let’s deconstruct the full phrase: Fencer A attacks, Fencer B blocks the attack by parry and tries to riposte. Fencer A parries this ripost of B and tries to counter riposte. Both opponents score. So 1st action – attack from A was interrupted by the parry of B who tries now to score in a riposte. Priority started with A, but due to certain defence from B is transferred to B. However this time A is smarter and she understands that continuing the same action of touch or doing another repetitive attempt to touch would not do any good – she must be certain in her counter-defense. So she takes a counter parry (i.e., interrupts the ripost of B) and hits B with counter-ripost. So attack from A was interrupted by parry from B. Priority temporarily goes to B.

The last action goes to Fencer A. Fencer B attempted to riposte and missed and he finished his action. Fencer A initiated a “new” attack by continuing to attempt to score, and in fencing we call that a remise. He continued to attack and was he interrupted? No. Instead of actively defending by parry, Fencer B had chosen to “passively” score the touch, not interrupting the renewed attack (or in professional fencing terms remise) of the Fencer A. Basically, it will be an attack of Fencer A, missed. Parry/riposte of Fencer B, missed. Remise (or attack from A), awarded. The remise and the priority of the call will go to Fencer A.

In the first moment, it is a bit of a weird action, but if we apply the same definition to it you will see it is not that weird at all and actually meets the criteria. Point in line is when a defending fencer fully extends the arm in a defence.The best way to think about “point in line” is like in ancient times defending with a spear. You stick it out, and if the attacker is not taking the spear out of their way completely, they will just run with their chest towards the pointy end and die! The spear is basically an active defence, even if the defending side does nothing but stays the ground with the spear out! If it remains in front of your chest the spear will pierce through you.

Fencer A does not beat or take a hold of the blade of Fencer B (i.e., leave the “spear” on the level of his chest), and both fencers score. Fencer B did a certain defense and thus gets the point. Had Fencer A beat the blade (in our medieval army analogy – took the spear out), then the last continuous uninterrupted action is on him, and so he is awarded the touch if both score. Pay attention to the “continuous” part. For example, if during this scenario Fencer B retracts the arm (even a bit!) and then extends it back, the phrase changes to his counter-attack, since the moment he retracted the arm ends his first action. Right of way example 10 There are two basic types of beat on a blade during an attack – a beat on a “weak” part of the blade, which is the last ⅔ of the blade, and a beat on a “strong” part of the blade, which is the widest part of the blade close to the guard. In case of a beat on the weak part of the blade, everything that we discussed before applies as is.

{"id": "web-e304b5d444-32", "text": "ything that we discussed before applies as is. The beat on the strong part of the blade of the defending opponent is very similar to the “point-in-line” concept. The idea is that the reason you beat the blade is to deflect it from your line of attack. Beating on the weak part makes you deflect it. However, when you beated the strong part of the blade, the part which is close to the guard and the arm of the opponent, it is often almost impossible to deflect the blade and for that reason it is considered that you simply got caught in the opponent’s certain defense. In which case if the opponent just extends their arm and scores this considered as parrying the attack, and essentially we can apply the same rule – attack was interrupted. Right of Way example 11 Suppose Fencer A goes forward and tries to deflect or hold the blade of opponent. Usually it looks like he is doing wise circle movements with his arm or hand. Why does he do this? Well, he wants to be “certain” to execute his attack and guarantee the hit. However let’s suppose that Fencer B is fast and every time he succeeds to avoid his opponent’s blade.

I think I gave you a hint in a description of the case. Fencer A was “uncertain” in his attack, thus he was searching the blade. So he executed an “uncertain” attack. So the defense of B gets the priority. Again – you must do “certain” action that “guarantees” your success. Right of Way example 12 Fencer A is attacking and Fencer B searching the blade (again, imaging circular movements of the blade). A is doing a certain attack – she clearly goes to score. However in that case B is trying to defend in a certain way by finding the attacker’s blade and getting it out of a dangerous zone. If she finds a blade (even a slight beat on her attacker’s blade is enough) – hooray, she certainly succeeded to defend and if both score the priority goes to her.

BTW, this last example shows why fencers often attack with raised foil – this is to prevent the defending fencer from succeeding in finding a blade. Oftentimes the defender needs to give away to some distance between him and the attacker to touch the blade and this might be very dangerous or an unsuccessful attempt to find the blade the defender might resolve to a “uncertain” defence by counter attacking, which might be dangerous too. These are the basic things. The most important thing is to understand what the last uninterrupted action is, and that’s hard! The thing to take away from this is that it is very subjective because it relies on a referee to see and correctly interpret the action. It’s all about how the referee sees the action and whether they can differentiate it or not. That is where the “clear” part of our definition comes in.

Reply Alan Buchwald on August 13, 2020 at 2:46 pm Dear Igor: Nice explanations of a very complex topic. In fact, we hardly realize how much more detail we can understand because we are experienced in fencing actively. And then it still can take a long time to get the nuances of directing. For example in competition, I have seen many times how some directors will totally miss the light click and sound of my parry and award the touch to the opponent inappropriately; in that case you must change your approach because you know they are not likely to pick it up the next time, so you must change your defense or simply make it one light on the box.

My kid is used to swing his blade from lower position up and strike in the chest or arm of his opponent. This way he often lands his foot first which make him lose most of the simul. Should he change his attack to a higher target so that his lunge is higher and foot lands later? Please advise. Thanks! Reply Igor Chirashnya on February 8, 2022 at 12:50 pm I recommend talking to your kid’s coach and analyzing how he does an attack and how his foot/arm are moving. Based on your description the ref considers the attack to be finished indeed without your child making a touch and so his consecutive touch is considered as a counter-attack. But the most important is to really talk to the coach and see what’s really wrong and why and then make changes to fix the mistake.

Reply R on January 16, 2024 at 1:01 pm You wrote “always contest hits judged against you”. You can not appeal a judgement of fact. In the least, your ref will view you unfavorably. Continuously can lead to a Group 1 Yellow Card for “Unjustified Appeal” or “Delay of Bout.” If you had a Yellow Card, such contention will penalize you a touch. Reply JM on January 20, 2024 at 6:00 pm You’re right. By contest I mean ask for video replay. That being said, I suggest communication should be done strictly through simple hand gestures: that’s the referee’s language.

Otherwise, absolutely, you wouldn’t want to argue with referees. Contesting, properly that is, won’t only earn you a couple of points: it will sway the way the referee judges the bout, and earn you more points. You will facilitate the referee’s job of reading the fencing phrase. And obviously my comments were intended tongue-in-cheek. In my opinion, your article is one of the best on the subject. There is something that does make sabre fencing complicated indeed: it’s the fencing phrase. As I see it, once you get the fencing phrase, priority takes care of itself. And after all, reading the fencing phrase is, as per the FIE regulations, the mandate of the referee. What makes it difficult is that it’s a French thing. Bearing in mind that French is to fencing what Japanese is to judo. For example, a fente is not a lunge: a lunge unbalances you forward, whereas a fente, which means a split, keeps you balanced for both forward and backward follow up. And that affects fencing time.

Reply JM on January 23, 2024 at 2:37 am First of all thank you so much, Igor, for making me think. And I mean really think. And what I’m thinking is that in the entirety of the FIE Saber regulations from t101 to t106, there is one word that never appears: the word “Priority”. So, and if you really deeply read those regulations, there is no such thing as priority. Strictly Validity of Hits within the Fencing Phrase. How’s that for a kick in the pants! Thanks Igor. Reply Igor Chirashnya on January 23, 2024 at 11:17 am No wonder Sabre got so many scandalous exposures recently 🙂 JMB on January 31, 2024 at 12:44 am I just had a long discussion on “Simple”.

{"id": "web-e304b5d444-45", "text": " Riposte. You aim for one light. In case of two lights: To be valid the Attack must be executed with a straightening of the Arm that touches “in time” that your Opponent did not parry. To be valid the Counterattack must stop hit a Compound attack “in time.” Which means it must hit in the Step Attack. And which means a Counterattack hit into a Lunge is not valid. And to be valid the Riposte must follow your Parry “in time.” And your Attack is not valid on a Straight Arm with a Blade pointed at you if you don’t first attack the Blade. To determine “Time”: Your Front Foot starts it when it leaves the ground but your Arm must initiate it, and the Front Foot again ends it when it meets the ground and the Arm must have touched by then. The Front Foot meeting the ground at the end of the Step in the Step-Lunge is what determines the Compound Time. On top of that you build your Bladework in between Front Footbeats: Attacks, Blade Attacks, Guards, Parries. I’d say that’s pretty much it, with a few nuances.

Priority is not a Fencing Action. There are only Four Fencing Actions: Attack, Counterattack, Defense and Preparation. Most people typically do a Fifth one: they do Nothing. That’s when you Attack them. So in addition to getting stuck wondering what to do next, standing with lead limbs in front of your Opponent, day dreaming about the meaning of fencing, you now confuse yourself with Priority. And not only do you fall behind your Opponent, now you switch your focus on the ref. Not a winning move. “Our method is to win” – Miyamoto Musashi, 1645 PS.

Igor on March 28, 2024 at 8:54 am Let’s say I initiate the attack which results in no parries, no touches. Opponent does not move or moves a step back. Then we both attack and both score. At what pause length after the first action the renewal of the same action becomes the remise (i.e. I lose priority)? Or the other way around, how fast do I need to “renew” the second attempt so it can be considered a continuation of the same attack? Is it even quantifiable or just a referee’s judgement call? My coach says if after the stop less than a second pass, and then we both attack, the priority is opponent’s. But if we wait the whole second and do it then, it’s considered simultaneous.

If you continue you either remiss (and then if the opponent scores then it will be his touch), or if you both wait “long enough” and then start together it will be simultaneous. How long is long is hard to say without watching the bout, as it’s measured in fencing tempo and then it also depends on the speed of actions and the distance that preceeded this action. The referee, officiating this bout would have a “feel” for when it’s a totally new action (simultaneous) or continuation of the previous one (remise), as well as fencers. And because it’s measured in fencing tempos, I wouldn’t say it’s 1 second. Sometimes it is shorter, sometimes it is longer as the tempo by itself is a changing from phrase to phrase. To understand why the duration between actions is not a standard 1 second, think about the same phrase in a bout between two 8-years olds versus in a bout between two Olympians. Obviously the first might have a full stop of a few seconds before they resume while Olympians will have the same action resumed after a split second. Makes sense?

Reply Ned Reiter on August 1, 2024 at 1:09 pm Very informative & more importantly useable explanations. As an “ancient” pre-electric fencer who started fencing in the 1960s (!) when bouts were overseen by 4 judges & a president, I have noticed how much harder it is to interpret a bout since the introduction of electric scoring equipment, and of course video replay facilities in high end competitions. When only the human eye and ear were available for interpreting a fencing bout, I believe that actions were more positively performed. All sports develop and move on I guess: although personally I still think the pistol grip ruins the look and feel of a weapon (I was taught foil in the traditional Italian school that emphasised finger manipulation)!

It takes a lot of practice! Even the world’s most famous fencing parents do not always get it. I do believe that, with time, most experienced fencing parents start understanding the concept a little bit. However, they have a hard time following quick actions. Which is understandable! I think you can teach yourself the concept and become quite good at it and thus enjoy fencing as a sport as well enjoy the fencing of your child even more. This last bit of advice that I’m giving you is good for fencers in general and for fencing parents as well.

Fencers just have an additional means of training in their club, while parents will use this as their major source of self-education. Here it is. The piece de resistance of learning fencing right of way. Watch videos! Lots of videos. My recommendation is to look at foil and sabre fencing videos at the World or Olympic level on the FIE channel on YouTube. There are three reasons for this. These videos are heavily commented on not only by the FIE commentators, but they also often invite famous fencers into their booth that help to explain the actions. There are slow motion replays. I personally would prefer if they didn’t focus on the last touch, because all too often they ignore the complete action. This makes it difficult to see totally what happened. Nevertheless, sometimes you do have an ability to see that parry that slipped past you in the first watch. The YouTube player has a capability to play the video with a different speed, from slow motion of 0.25 normal speed to 2x fast. This will allow you to play and replay the same action and better understand what happened.

Another fantastic source of fencing education, and in my opinion definitely the best in the world, is CyrusOfChaos on Youtube and Instagram. There you will find tons (literally years!) of videos with great analysis and comments. An additional bonus to learning from Cyrus’s material are the tactical and situational decisions and technical actions. It’s a gold mine! Don’t just watch videos passively though! Stop the video just before the referee calls the touch, or whenever you think you see one. Try to explain to yourself what you saw. If you need to, rewind and replay in slow motion. It’s ok to make a mistake! That means you’re learning. It means you’re growing. With time, those mistakes will be fewer and fewer. The same idea goes with competitions (when they resume). Watch the ref and compare your own mental calls with the final call. Look for vocal objections from the coaches.

Deepening your understanding of foil and sabre bouts Personally, I find both foil and sabre matches fascinating to watch. The huge amount of actions are a constant puzzle that needs solving. This provides the brain with a large amount of stimuli as we try to decipher the action. Once you start understanding right of way, even at a very basic level, watching foil and sabre is just incredibly fun. Like solving a rubik’s cube or mastering a brain teaser, only with swords! The overarching, top line, ten thousand foot view of foil and sabre has everything to do with their dynamics. Sabre is fast-paced. How fast? So fast that they don’t even have a timer! The sabre bout stops at eight points for a one-minute break and only has two periods. You will rarely see more than a few seconds, usually with no more than five seconds between two consecutive points. Anecdotally, I would estimate that more than nine out of ten of all sabre actions happen within less than five seconds of the previous action.

By the time the referee has even had a thought to press the stop button, the fencers have already scored the hit. So why bother? And so there is no timer in sabre. Who’s moving first? A lot of times both fencers charge towards each other when the referee says “Fence!” or “Allez!”, and most of the time both will hit. In sabre, who starts first is SUPER important. The referee will see much clearer the movement in the arms and the legs and will define the attack based on that. In sabre, it’s one of the most common situations. Parries and counter-parries In both sabre and foil, parries and counter-parries are common. They happen less in sabre because it is more difficult to block a hit. What happens more in sabre than in foil are the subtle stops and misses. Here’s quite a common situation in sabre fencing. Fencer A starts with a lunge, and it looks like she will hit. At the same time, Fencer B hits. The initial reaction might be that this is an attack from Fencer A. However, A sometimes misses the touch and B has started right away, and it all happens so fast that the feeling is that A hit the first time.

However, A sometimes misses the touch and B has started right away, and it all happens so fast that the feeling is that A hit the first time. An experienced referee will spot this. An inexperienced observer will not. Subtle stops There are many subtle stops in sabre. The feeling of the opponent stopping is at a whole different level in sabre fencers. They are like having this play out in real slow motion. They feel the stop, then have the ability to switch from one direction to another in a truly unusual and unprecedented way. While this same thing is true of foil and epee fencers, the way that it happens with sabre fencers is unique in my opinion. One of the beautiful nuances of the sport of fencing. In sabre, these situations almost always guarantee that both fencers will jump in yelling to claim that they made the touch. That dynamic is part of the excitement when watching these fights! Less in-fighting While foil fencing happens a lot in close quarters (when fencers are very close to each other, often called in-fighting), this does not happen in sabre almost at all.

Most of the time sabre fencers maintain a distance from each other consistently. With the whole blade being able to even slightly touch the whole body from the waist up to register a point, it is impossible to avoid being unintentionally touched by an opponent’s blade in a close combat for sabre fencers. Better keep her far away at all times and keep the distance between fencers is more than in foil when they are engaged. With fewer parries, more amplitude of arm movement, and more distance in sabre, I personally find it a bit easier to follow the blade action in sabre. These are a few major differences that it helps to notice when watching sabre and foil, but there are many more. I’ll stop here to keep from overwhelming you. I will point you to one fantastic resource on the internet that will help to build out your understanding of sabre phrases and rules of right of way – Sabre Referees on Instagram and Facebook.

They publish small blurbs of fencing bouts, then ask for opinions and explanations. Many sabre specialists and fans chime in to express their opinion, and then at the end the sabre referees come back to provide the correct answer. I highly recommend that you subscribe to this account and start following them. These videos give you a real time breakdown of these matches and provide a consistent resource. You will start seeing these small differences in who started first, or when one opponent stopped and another re-took the initiative. When you start seeing it in sabre, I am sure watching the same situations in foil will be much easier – the speed of foil is slower than that of sabre. These are the basics! Right of way is something that takes much practice and observation. Clearly novice fencers, families, and fans of fencing have to keep watching and reading about it to learn how to decipher it.

However, understanding and using the National Points List is crucial to advancing in competition and growing as a fencer. The more you understand how national points are awarded and factor into a fencer’s place on the national points list, the easier it is to take advantage of competitive opportunities that could boost your ranking.

Regional points are earned with similar mechanics, but for now, we’ll focus on national points as they apply across the board. Understanding National Points It must be pointed out that national points are not the same thing as classification ratings . Classification ratings are formatted as letter grades, with A being the highest and E the lowest. U stands for ”unrated” and is what novice fencers start off with. One of the key things to keep in mind is that in addition to the U-A classification rating awarded in competition, there is a national (and to some extent regional) ranking of the fencers in every weapon and age group that more accurately reflects the strengths of the athletes competing in these events. Like classification ratings, national points can serve as a measuring tool for coaches to accurately track the progress and expectations of their fencers. While neither classification ratings nor national points paint complete pictures of a fencer’s ability to perform in competition, national points offer insight into a fencer’s level of success throughout their season.

They suggest that fencers with more points may fare better in national tournaments. Being on the list and/or at a certain level on the list is how a fencer qualifies for various levels of competition. The National Points List, officially known as the National Rolling Points Standing (NRPS), tracks the amount of points awarded to fencers in their national competitions. The NRPS offers individualized lists for athletes competing in their respective weapon and age groups. NRPS for qualification The most important benefit of national points for a fencer is having them determines fencer’s eligibility to qualify for competition. Competitions that require qualifications are national championships in any age category, from youth to Senior Division 1, and July Challenge for Cadet, Junior and Senior Division 1 category.

Similarly, USA Fencing uses national points to create an initial seeding (=ranking) at national and regional events. College programs use this list to recruit prospective fencers into their schools while competing coaches and fencers may refer to the standard to get an idea of where their opponents rank on a national level. National points are earned at national-level domestic events (e.g., NAC’s, Championships, SJCC, SYC’s) and in designated international tournaments as well. If a fencer competes internationally and is awarded points, the international points from their tournaments are calculated into the NRPS, adding to their amount of national points and impacting their ranking on the list. It is important to note that national points expire one year after they are awarded. This is why they’re called “rolling points”, because they are a rolling list that changes constantly.

A fencer can hold onto the points they accumulated by competing in a tournament equivalent to the one in which they achieved their points. If the fencer becomes ineligible to compete in tournaments or does not gain these points back before the one year is up, then respective points from the same year-ago tournament expire. National points are also gender/weapon/age specific and while there is a connection between them by the means of propogation from the higher level tournament (i.e., older age to younger age category within the same weapon/gender), the lists are independent. For example, if a fencer is on Cadet list and Junior list, his or her seeding and qualification for that specific category is based exclusively on the NRPS for that category only. Earning National Points In all weapon and age groups, fighting for national points is an essential part of the competitive process, and at times it can be intense, mostly when there is a national team membership at stake.

The only exception to this is international points which factor into a fencer’s placement on the NRPS. Fencers have the opportunity to compete for points at the July Challenge, the National Championships, and the North American Cups as part of national circuit and SYC (for Youth) and SJCC (for Cadet/Juniors) as part of regional circuit. In national-level tournaments, national points are awarded to the top 40% of finalists at the July Challenge, National Championships, and NACs, capped at 32 if there are fewer than 160 competitors, or to top 64 fencers if there are at least 160 fencers The Super Youth Circuit (SYC) and Super Junior and Cadet Circuit (SJCC) tournaments handle national point distribution a bit differently. While points are still earned by the top 40% of finalists in the SYC and SJCC events, these competitions award only a fraction of the national points that are awarded to participants of national tournaments.

While SJCC tournaments are newer and usually only held during Grand Prix and World Cup competitions during the last few seasons in pre-pandemic era, and not yet resumed since then, they also award points at a fraction of national tournaments. SJCC competitors receive only 0.2 of the points given at the national level. Youth fencers typically participate in their own age group or one above theirs. However, these fencers may become eligible to compete in older age groups if they have earned national points in the age group above their own, making them eligible to participate in these older groups in tournaments. Ranking on National Points List USA Fencing gives national points to eligible participants in the following age groups: Youth-10 Youth-12 Youth-14 Cadet (Under 16) Junior (Under 19) Seniors Division 1 (Over 13) Veteran 40-49 (V40) Veteran 50-59 (V50) Veteran 60-69 (V60) Veteran 70-79 (V70) Veteran 80-89 (V80) All Veteran (V-Open) The Division 1 is an open upper age tournament with the only age requirement being tha", "source": "https://academyoffencingmasters.com/blog/understanding-the-national-ranking-system-in-fencing", "title": "Understanding the National Ranking System in Fencing - Academy of Fencing Masters", "tags": [], "date": ""}

Fencers must be in good standing with USA Fencing to compete. Any age group that falls outside of this list, such as Youth-8, is ineligible to receive national points in that age group. When determining a fencer’s eligibility, USA Fencing only considers the birth year of the fencer , and not the day or month in which they were born. National tournaments allot a different number of national points based on category. Here is the amount of national points given to the finalists in each age group: Youth-10 = 100 points Youth-12 = 150 points Youth-14 = 200 points Cadet (U16) = 400 points Junior (U19) = 600 points Seniors (Division I) = 1000 points All Veterans = 400 points International events have much higher weight than their respective national events, which is an obvious thing – after all, we want our fencers to compete in the ranks of the national team at the World scene, and having them perform well counts!

Important to note that if a fencer earns points in his or her age group and in one of two age groups above, the final points are based on all these results and points are not normalized based on the age category in which they are calculated, but are taken for their absolute value. For example, suppose an Y10 fencer earned 70 points in Y10 national event and the next day she earned 150 points in Y12 event, both results are taken for their face value when considered for Y10 NRPS – as 70 and 150 points. While for her Y12 NRPS only 150 points earned in Y12 event are considered.

It’s intimidating, but mostly it exciting. It’s a time in a fencer’s career that they can never quite capture again, one that most fencers look back on fondly. You’re going to look back on it fondly too someday! Starting off is not easy though. These tips are good for new fencers who haven’t yet tried their hand at the sport, but who are excited to dig in. These tips are also good for fencing parents and for fencers who don’t know what to expect! 1.

Scratches and pokes do happen, but these are almost always minor and easy to get used to. So many safety precautions are put into place that fencing turns actually into a very safe option. Fencing, despite being focused on a weapon, is one of the safest sports that you can participate in. Chess is a little safer, but soccer is definitely less safe! There is much more likelihood of getting injured on the softball field or at a golf course than on the fencing strip. What’s going to keep you safe is to follow the rules of the club and to always be aware. You’ll hear your coaches repeat safety measures over and over again. Listen to them! Beginner fencing bonus tip – Safety always comes first in fencing. Work from the very beginning to make sure that you know how to wear and use the fencing protective gear and that you’re listening very carefully to the coach about safety guidelines. 2.

Though it may not look like there is a lot happening, no one is running across a field, it takes a great deal of stamina to get through a few minutes of a fencing match. Doing simple cardio to support stamina, like running or a stationary bike, can make a huge difference with how much fun and productive fencing training is. One of the things that wins matches in the long run is that one fencer is able to sustain that good fencing for the whole match while the other gets worn out halfway through and their technique begins to suffer. Stamina wins a whole lot of fencing bouts! Beginner fencing bonus tip – Don’t put too much emphasis on cross training just yet. See that you really like fencing and want to make it your sport for real. Later on when you know you are committed to fencing and want to make progress, then you can add some additional conditioning. Two to three times a week of running or swimming for a half hour can make a huge difference though. 3. Get used to getting hit This is a sport, not a duel.

You are going to get hit hundreds and eventually thousands of times if you stick with the sport for long enough. You’re wearing protective gear that’s going to keep you from feeling the vast majority of the strikes that come your way. The earlier you get over the fear of being hit, the faster you’re going to start enjoying the sport. Beginner fencing bonus tip – Always wear full fencing gear , including knickers and socks, so your whole body is covered. If you are a beginner boy, no matter the age, and even if your fellow “experienced” fencers don’t wear chest guards, wear one. Later on when getting hit became the norm for you and you will stop feeling them, you can take the chest guard off, but in the meantime the chest guard will help. Also, seriously consider wearing groin protection . 4.

The muscles literally burn for a while! That’s because you’re using muscles that you’ve never used before! After you’ve practiced for a few weeks, those muscles are going to get used to these new positions. The pain and discomfort are going to go away really fast! It’s one of those things that you just have to tough out for a little while to see a great improvement. Your fencing coach can guide you through stretches that will make the positions easier to get into and less uncomfortable. Be sure to ask your coach questions often and openly. As much as it is tempting to give yourself some slack and stay on the straight legs, don’t give in to this temptation. Continue to maintain a proper fencing position despite being tired. It is better ask for a short break to shake your legs out than to try to make it easier by going half way in your fencing stance. Old habits die hard, so make it a habit to be correct all the time.

Talk to your coach what exercises you should routinely do and which ones are good for after a specially hard training. Also, when at home try soaking in a warm bath of epsom salts if it’s too much to handle the muscle soreness in the first few weeks. 5. You’ll be focusing on your feet You probably think that fencing is all about the sword, but it’s not. Fencing is all about the footwork . Especially in the beginning, so much of your training is going to be about getting your footwork right. Moving up and down the strip effectively and controlling the distance in your bout is what allows a fencer to be the master of the strip! Yes, the sword is important, but the legs and feet are the real stars. When you start fencing, those will be a major focus of your training! Learning how to do proper footwork is a foundation of good fencing. You’ll be working on this a whole lot, and right from the very start.

Check out our fencing shoe guide if you want to learn more. 6. Start with the basics It can be very tempting to go online and find all kinds of fencing tips, but when you’re a beginner fencer you’re going to get yourself into trouble if you do that. Start with the basics and stay with the basics for a long time. In fact, fencers really never need to stop focusing on the basics. Whether it’s posture or stances, footwork or focus, straight touch, simple parry – the basics of fencing stay the same. Some techniques will change over time, but fundamentally fencing is always the same! There is necessarily a lot of repetition in learning a sport. You are teaching your body and your mind to do something very new. Often the body and mind aren’t so crazy about whatever you’re teaching them. Basic movements and techniques have to be reinforced again and again to maintain them. Beginner fencing bonus tip – Keeping it simple is what the best fencers in the world do! 7.

Don’t practice at home in the beginning Yes, we want you to put in as much practice as you can. No, practicing fencing at home is not good for beginners . Whatever you do over and over again is going to be what your body naturally does. When you’re at home, you don’t have a coach to watch and ensure that you’re doing your practice correctly. So if you do that lunge a hundred times on Saturday and then come back to fencing practice on Monday, you’re probably going to find out that you weren’t quite doing it right! Now you’ll have to relearn it, and that is much more difficult than learning it right the first time. Over time you’ll know fencing well enough to be able to practice at home, but that won’t happen for a while. Beginner fencing bonus tip – If you want to improve your fencing in the off-hours, work on cross training to improve your stamina. Running, biking, or swimming are all great options.

Bring a water bottle Fencing gear is hot, and fencing is a sport with a whole lot of movement. In order to train effectively, you’re going to need to stay hydrated . Bring a water bottle to practice from the very start and get into the habit of drinking regularly during practice. That goes for drinking before and after practice too. When you are training in fencing, you’ll have to take your body’s needs seriously. A lot of people forget about how important it is to drink! This simple thing will go a long way towards keeping your body healthy and your fencing training going well. Beginner fencing bonus tip – If you struggle with hydration, get a really cool water bottle (try a fencing sticker!). This will help you to remember to drink.

{"id": "web-53ac2a04b7-9", "text": ". Though, in truth, every sport can be expensive if you buy the top of the line equipment. Yes, the biggest fencers in the world use very high quality, very expensive fencing gear. The gear is not what makes them champions though. Spending a lot of money on weapons or protective gear when you are new to the sport won’t suddenly make you better. What will make you better is practice, patience, and more practice. The pricey equipment is really cool, and the top fencing equipment companies are making high quality equipment that can be well worth the price. However, more basic equipment is also generally very well made and also worth its price! Beginner fencing bonus tip – Talk to your fellow fencers or your coach what is the right mid-range gear. Don’t go for the cheapest “ beginner fencing kit ”, because in most cases these are the lowest quality gear. While it might save you some money in the short term, usually you will end up replacing everything 6 months later. Instead, go for something that is more durable and reliable. Also, if you have friends that outgrew their gear , this might be a good temporary solution as well. 10.

Be prepared to lose Part of the process of fencing is losing . It’s not a bad thing though! You will lose often, during practice and then if you decide to compete. Every single fencing bout has a loser! It has a winner too, but someone is going to be on both sides. You’re going to be on the lower point side often, and that’s ok! You’re going to learn that losing is not as bad as you think . After a while of training, fencers learn that it doesn’t bother them so much. Once you embrace that losing is just as much a part of the process as putting on the mask, it’ll roll right off of your shoulders. Beginner fencing bonus tip – Losing a fencing match is the best place to learn. Every loss is a golden opportunity to improve, much more so that winning a fencing match! Don’t report to your parents or all of your friends after every training how many bouts you won today in the practice. This does not matter and it takes away the learning part of the fencing.

Listen. There is no secret to success in fencing. All you have to do is to show up, practice, and listen. No magic. If you want to be a successful fencer, right from the very start you have to learn that this is a learning venture. Just coming to practice, every time, is the first step. The next step is to be invested in that practice and to do the work. The third is to listen to the coaches and mentors that you have, learning from your mistakes and improving your thinking and technique along the way. There are lots of other components to learning and growing in fencing, but all of those are built from the foundation of being at practice, putting in the work, and listening to your coach. These are things that every single successful fencer, in fact every single successful athlete, all have in common. Beginner fencer bonus tip – Every practice is not going to be perfect.

No one is going to keep doing something that they don’t enjoy. Yes, there are tough times in training when you have to push through, but most of all the training should be a lot of fun. This sport is a cool sport. It’s an exciting sport. Whatever the reasons that you have come to fencing in the first place, the cool factor and the exciting factor are likely a big part of that. Take joy in the sport! Beginner fencer bonus tip – Get to know your fellow fencers and your coach. The fun of fencing is most fun when it’s shared! It’s ok to feel overwhelmed with fencing early on!

It’s a reality of what we are working with, and it is a problem that we are likely to see continue for the long haul as the pandemic progresses through the next few months or longer. Even in normal times, fencers can find themselves in training bouts that are not challenging, depending on their level and what kinds of fencers live nearby and can train with them regularly. Training partners are important, especially as we progress in fencing . For many elite athletes it is often a norm to go back to their native clubs and train there. They aren’t always training in national camps or with their teams. Most of the time they go back home, where they don’t have the same level of training partners and are with younger fencers. Nick Itkin told us about this experience and also Mara Navarria shared her experience, and it was eye opening. There are ways to learn to do this effectively!

An exercise in frustration When you face a training opponent, or even a competitive opponent, who is considerably weaker than you are, that puts you constantly on the offensive. It can be likened to learning to write, you are using one hand all the time and so that becomes the dominant hand. When you try to write with the other hand, it’s not successful because you haven’t developed it. Training only offense is one-sided. When you are facing an opponent who is not able to provide a competitive offense, it can feel like “Oh, I don’t feel anything.” It’s like you are fencing against someone who is almost not even there. This is hugely frustrating! It seems like less of an exercise and more of a waste of time. That is a harsh way of looking at it from the perspective of the person who is less experienced, but it is the reality of how many fencers experience these kinds of training bouts.

Fencers who push to higher levels but are from small clubs experience it as they grow more adept at their art. It can become an exercise in frustration instead of an exercise in fencing training. What can you do? A lot of fencers get discouraged about this. Go from winning to learning The thing is that it doesn’t matter who you are fencing against, you can always find ways to challenge yourself and grow. When you fence, you need to change the emphasis from winning to learning . Now with little to no competitions, the emphasis can’t be on winning – it has to be on learning. You can put a lot of things into your fencing, for example you do things that you learned in private lessons or things that you saw on Youtube videos , things that you watched in competitions.

It is a wonderful way to learn that should not be wasted. This is a place where you can focus on very technical aspects of your fencing and try to do them to perfection. You aren’t trying to win against your opponent, you are trying to push yourself to add things to your repertoire that were not there before. Changing the tone of your fencing is much easier in these kinds of training bouts than it is when you are constantly on the defensive end. What works and what does not? What feels right? You can try not to just win but try to learn. In our interview with champion fencer Max Heinzer , he told us that oftentimes when he fences with easier partners, he works on his technique. This is where he tries out new touches and ideas that he has had. He doesn’t care whether he loses because it is only practice for him.

The amazing thing here is that you can execute the action that you want to execute in real time. This can become very physical and very physically challenging, but also mentally freeing and exciting if you allow it to be. When you are with a weaker opponent you can oftentimes much easier set up situations where you can execute exactly the technique that you want to execute. When you are fencing a person you can draw them in to attack, then do a parry riposte. It’s not the same as doing it with a fencing coach where you are practicing the line and know exactly where the blade is going to go. When it’s very well presented, it’s very easy for you to execute the action and perform the technique. In fencing against an easier opponent, it’s a situation where you can become self determining.

Taking charge of your mental attention is so important for fencers, but it is not something that we always have time to practice. This is a perfect opportunity to challenge your ability to stop that mind wandering. Explore your own accountability You can then start to even take things to the next level. Hold yourself accountable in various ways to push yourself. Maybe you say that you will do five pushups or five sit ups if you lose. You could do this same metric if you don’t win by a certain number of points that you decide beforehand.

Mentorship is a necessary part of our sport, and by engaging in these bouts that might not be so challenging to you, you are participating in mentorship for another fencer.

The fencers who we see having huge success, those who are far at the top of the field, they are not unattainable ultra-human individuals who are far beyond us. These fencers are just like everyone else. The difference is that they have been diligent, inventive, and most of all consistent. You can get to wherever it is you want to go in this sport, even in the face of the limitations that other people put on you. Even in the face of a global pandemic.

You can focus on individual lessons , group lessons, line drills, good advice, books you read, and competitive experience, but all is for not, if you don’t know how to spar. I was a boxer for many years before I ever heard of fencing. The one thing that separated boxers from people who ended up not boxing was sparring technique. You think in boxing you have an option. Perhaps you decide to work on your development. If you think that boxing and competition are the same thing, they’re going to get out there and try to knock each other out and there can be no learning.

Boxers soon learn that there has to be a way to train without making it all out warfare. Sparring means we don’t hit hard, it means we hit for touches. When boxers learn to hit for touches, they are really learning power, because they learn to control the quality of the punch, which develops tremendous sensitivity. With the control it takes to hit lightly, you automatically learn to release your energy so that you can go as hard as you want to and there is no limit to how hard that can be given the right timing and distance. People who go on slugging all the time and cannot slow down and control the quality of their actions never learn to hit hard. The same is true in fencing, but it is more difficult to see because in fencing you can hit someone really hard and not hurt them. You can go for touches and there is nothing that reminds you that that might not be the way to go. If you start slugging in boxing, someone gets hurt pretty fast and those two boxers quit boxing each other, so they have nobody to train with.

In fencing, you have an alternative. You can fence for touches, which means competition or you can fence for sparring, which means the learning process in light competitive practice. The learning process is the focal point and the action of scoring touches is the secondary factor. Sparring offers the fencer the same as it offers the boxer–a place where you can go try things out. If it does not work, that’s fine. It has not cost anything. On failing an action, you learn what you should not be doing, which is more important than what you should be doing. Fencing is a subtractive process rather than an additive one. In the process of fencing and in sparring, you are learning what you should discontinue in your game. You shed the over-reaction, you shed too much attack-oriented fencing, you shed this and that and pretty soon you end up with the stuff that works.

If you come for an evening of fencing and do nothing but get into ego contests, where you are so insecure and uptight about what you are doing that you can’t afford to be hit and that your whole motivation is nothing but hitting your opponent all the time, you’re not going to learn anything. Come ten years from now, you will be fencing the same way you are right now. It is the old saying, “practice slow and learn fast.” Sparring allows you to do that. When I come for an evening of sparring, which means I am going to fence at about 70% speed and strength, I set a goal. I decide to be very conscious about distance and footwork . In the process of doing that, I am going to get hit a lot. My opponents may not know that I am sparring. They may be getting excited that he is hitting, but who is learning? Chances are that I am going to be learning more than they are. To top that, they are under the illusion that they are fencing someone at full strength, but they are really getting a very false impression.

Occasionally you should say “Let’s go 5 or 10 touches, or the whole evening of competition”. In that way everyone knows what is going on. Unfortunately, you may go in for an evening of sparring and come up against some “ninny” who thinks it is a competition and is hitting you all the time. You feel your adrenalin release and your own insecurities come to the surface. Suddenly the guy hits you again and you decide to get even. You hit them and suddenly the sparring is over and you end up with what I call Ulin, Minnesota level competition. Competition between two guys where it does not make any difference. There are no medals on the table and there are no score sheets–that’s just a waste of time. A nice procedure for sparring is to set a goal for yourself. Set an assignment for yourself and fence the whole evening just trying to set your opponent up for that move or action to see if you can control him/her enough to bring off that move.

You are saying to yourself, “I won’t do this and I won’t do that. I’m going to fence the whole evening and I won’t score unless I can do this action”. By giving yourself a restriction, all aspects of the game begin to clarify. The things you don’t allow yourself to do reveal themselves. You begin to ask yourself “why did you put those restrictions on myself?” This forces you to realize the strength of the things you are not using, plus you put yourself in a position to try new techniques that you can’t afford to try when you are out for serious touches. You can actually try techniques that you are very weak on so you are going to get hit a lot, but in time that stuff is going to come together if you keep working on it and you’ve patched up one part of your game.

If you’ve got someone who absolutely refuses to attack and you were planning to work on your parries, instead of both of you looking at each other the whole time, you might just switch your emphasis and see if you can get him to attack you by moving in or by presenting a bigger invitation. If this does not work, maybe it is time to call it quits and practice your attacks instead. So, for the whole evening you just try to set the time up for a direct action. Maybe, you won’t get but one out of ten to work the entire evening. However, if you can get one to work, I’ll assure you, you can get two to work the next evening. The next evening you might be able to get four to work. Pretty soon you are on the road to scoring with simple and direct actions. Another person might say “I am going to practice my direct attacks. They try and try and it just fails and they are not getting anything out of the practice except frustration. Maybe at that point they are ready to change their sparring assignment. “Well, since I can’t hit on a direct action, maybe I should try practicing one-two or beat disengage attacks.”", "source": "https://academyoffencingmasters.com/blog/philosophy-of-sparring-by-charles-selberg/", "title": "Philosophy of Sparring by Charles Selberg - Academy of Fencing Masters", "tags": [], "date": ""}

You should find no end of the things you are able to spar with. What I like to do as a sparring procedure with any given individual I fence, is start off sparring. I have fenced for so many years that it doesn’t take but ten seconds for me to find out what I can work on. I like to practice things I don’t do well. Now, what I also like to do, at the end of a sparring session, is say “Okay, let’s fence five.” That way you can get the competition out of your system. You’ll find that if you can fence for an hour without seriously being dragged into the competition, which means sparring, when you finally allow yourself to fence for touches, your game just goes straight into the air.

If you can get used to fencing at less than what you perceive is your full capacity, all sorts of wonderful learning experiences happen. You’ll be able to see things more clearly. You do not have so much adrenaline in your system, so you can more objectively see what you are doing. At the end of the evening fence for touches and see the contrast between the sparring and the competitive approach. Sparring does not mean that you go out and let people hit you all the time. It means you commit yourself to a particular line of action that you are not good at or that you need improvement in and see if you can work on that and still survive. You might as well know that as long as you fence your strongest game during informal combat, you are not progressing.

You will learn to fence at less than full capacity. To fence with less than you think you have and, all of a sudden, you discover a wealth of material you didn’t know you had. A person who is always fencing at 100% in practice situations, has very little chance of winning. Sparring allows you an unknown quantity in the relationship and you realize that tournaments are nothing but unknown quantities. Sparring keeps you in touch with having to face a situation where it is not always nailed down like a lesson. Sparring is a special world that champions live in and the non-champions can’t understand. It is a whole world unto itself. It takes much more skill to fence well beneath your game, than it does just to turn everything on that you’ve got. If you come out and fence at about 80% of your strength, you’ll find your game will get better, plus when the crunch is on, you’ll find your strengths will get better too.

You don’t need to throw everything at the person regardless of who you are. Learning to fence at a slower speed than you can actually go is just excellent for learning to restrict yourself and to stay on that restriction. In tournament fencing, if you are up against tough competition your ability to change and do something else is just survival. You just can’t go out and do your strength or specialty because they’ll stop that every time. Once your specialty fails, you’ve got to have something to fall back on, so you can still change your game and come out on top. If you discover it’s 4-0 in favor of your opponent and you can’t change, you might as well give them the last touch. Sparring is very important for the competitive fencer. It really counts on the strip. You can fence someone a thousand times in practice and beat them, but the only time it counts is in competition. People tend to forget that.

I tell my fencers if they are winning all their bouts, they are doing something wrong, because they are not practicing their weaknesses. One type of sparring might be to work on specific actions and another might be to work on the basics. The best fencers in the world still work on their footwork–still work on their lunges and mobility. The only difference is that they are doing this while they are facing an opponent. It is a whole different thing to take a lesson where the teacher is trying to help you. When you are working with an opponent, they are not trying to help you at all. Sparring enables you to make that transfer. If you are not sure what action to work on just free fence for a while and you’ll see. If you are working on an action and it is successful, you know that action is good and should work in the competition. There is no sense in continuing to practice it.

It is very different from a line drill where you tell your partner you want to do this or that. He doesn’t know and that’s also part of the sparring–to mask your intentions. After all, in fencing, you want to mask your true intentions from your opponent . You want to keep your opponent guessing. Your partner should not know you are sparring. The best thing if you are successful with an action is not to use that again. Work on the things you do not feel comfortable doing. Free fencing never really does anything for your game. You are prone to get big and prone to carelessness. A very important factor in fencing is if you get touched, to know why you got touched. Were you too slow? Too big? If you don’t understand that you will keep on getting touched with the same action over and over again. If you don’t know how or why you were hit, ask your opponent.

Charles Alan Palmer Selberg passed away at home on March 29th, 2012 at the age of 81 after a brief battle with lung cancer. He was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota on August 2 nd ,1930. The ideas Charles Selberg expressed at Michael D’saro’s summer fencing camp have been a tremendous help to me and my students. While this lecture was presented in 1978, the essence of his message remains timeless.

However, there’s a universal truth that resonates deeply with fencers: it’s the importance of mastering patience in our journey toward success. In competitive fencing, everything often takes longer than we anticipate. We set our sights on achieving specific skills or rankings, winning that national medal, or getting recruited to a top college , and often we envision a swift ascent to success. But reality teaches us that the path to excellence is more of a marathon than a sprint and that patience is not just a virtue but an indispensable ally in your fencing journey.

The Fencing Life: A Test of Patience Skill Development: Fencing demands precision and finesse, which take time to cultivate. Whether you’re perfecting your parries or refining your footwork, patience is key. Recognize that steady progress is more valuable than quick wins, and be patient with yourself as you advance. Competitive Journey: Fencers often find themselves waiting for opportunities—tournament results, that elusive victory, or a chance to represent your club or country. Patience in the face of uncertainty is your ally. Keep honing your skills, and your moment will come. Long-Term Commitment: Success in fencing seldom happens overnight. It’s a journey that requires years of dedication and persistent effort. Patience reminds us that overnight sensations are a rare breed, and many successful fencers have toiled in relative obscurity for years before their breakthrough.

Every defeat is an opportunity to learn and grow, inching closer to your goals. Navigating Comparisons: In the world of fencing, comparisons are inevitable . You’re constantly measured against your teammates, opponents, and even your own past performances. Patience teaches us to focus on our personal growth rather than getting caught up in the whirlwind of comparisons. Understand that every fencer has their unique journey and pace of development. Embracing Unequal Opportunities: Fencing, like life, doesn’t always offer equal opportunities to everyone. Some may have the privilege of extensive resources, while others face constraints. Patience reminds us to appreciate our circumstances and not take them for granted. If you’re blessed with abundant opportunities, acknowledge them with gratitude. Conversely, if your path is less paved, learn to make the most of what you have, turning limitations into strengths through mastering patience and resourcefulness.

Navigating Drought Periods: Even the most successful fencers face drought periods when nothing seems to work. It’s crucial to learn to navigate these challenging times with patience. Maintain your hope, have grit in the face of difficulty, and sustain reasonable optimism. Remember that these periods are temporary, and your patience will see you through. Dealing with Skepticism: Along your fencing journey, you may encounter skepticism, even from those close to you, such as parents or coaches. Patience is essential, not just with the journey and yourself, but also with them. Rather than reacting defensively or angrily, understand their perspective and find constructive ways to address their concerns while maintaining your optimism and determination. Knowing When to Adapt: As with any endeavor, discerning when and how to change course is crucial. Patience enables you to differentiate between stubbornness and flexibility.

Patience teaches you to rise above negativity, ignore the naysayers, and focus on your path to success. Sometimes, those who oppose you today may become your staunch supporters tomorrow. Remaining Humble in Victory: Patience fosters humility in the face of success. It reminds you that every triumph is the result of perseverance and effort, and failures often follow or precede these victories. Stay grounded, be supportive of others, and acknowledge that success is a shared journey. Embracing the Fencing Village: Patience teaches you the value of community. In fencing, as in life, you can’t do it alone. Your network of support, including parents, teammates, coaches, and even opponents, is vital.

Recognize that success is a collaborative effort, and your patient appreciation of everyone’s contributions is a testament to your character. In fencing, the virtue of patience stands as a silent but formidable champion. It’s a truth we hold self-evident: mastering this sport takes time, effort, and patience. Without mastering patience, you cannot achieve long-term success. What we glean from the fencing strip echoes beyond the confines of the sport. Patience isn’t just a fencing skill; it’s a life virtue. It nurtures resilience, persistence, and a profound appreciation for the journey itself. With patience as your guiding star, you’ll not only excel in fencing but also in the grand theater of existence.

This is all the more confusing because there are also divisional competitions within the structure of qualification for the Junior Olympics and Fencing Summer Nationals. Those competitions aren’t related to Divisions 1, 1A, 2, and 3, but rather they just share a name. There are many, many divisional competitions that cover a specific region or even down to a specific city. These hyper regionally focused tournaments cover a wide range of qualifying event classes, which are often tailored to the kind of fencing that is popular in that particular area. For Divisions 1, 1A, 2 and 3, participation is actually fairly straightforward. These four categories have their own set of parameters, and they carry a specific weight in the fencing competition circuit.

Basics of Divisional Categories in Fencing Fencing categories are structured based on age to begin with. How fencing age is measured is its own thing, and you can read about that in our previous blog about what a “ fencing birthday ” is if you need a better grasp on it. Here for ease, we’re going to simplify by using ages only. Youth through Junior categories have detailed age requirements that are focused on a set age group. The Senior category flips the switch to being about something else in addition to the age requirement. All four divisions include the same age – thirteen and higher. This is what makes the Senior category unique in the United States. In addition to age requirements, there are stipulations of level in each Division. Note that in all of the Youth categories, as well as in the Cadet and Junior categories, there is an “age out” timeframe in which fencers are no longer permitted to compete in these categories. Though there is a broad single Veteran category for everyone aged 40 and above, there are also more narrow age categories for each Veteran.

This allows Veterans to compete with people who are of a similar physical ability level – on the whole, a forty year old and an eighty year old have very different physical capabilities. Keep in mind that, in theory, a person who is eighty years old could absolutely compete in at least two Senior Divisions. There is no age limit on either one. In fact, the only limit on the Senior category is that a fencer must be 13 or older. Why is there no age cap in the Division categories? The main reason is that Fencing Divisions are less reliant on age than they are on the ability of each fencer to perform. Here, fencers are not tied to their chronological age in order to compete – it’s whoever is the best fencer once they are physically roughly adult sized, which is around 13.

It’s worth reinforcing here that this is the way that this is done in the United States. International competition is a whole different ballgame, with rules and regulations that are different. Each country’s fencing body sets its own guidelines. Because these competitive levels are connected by fencers’ rating (or the correct term, used only by very few people -fencers classifications). This is an American fencing thing that doesn’t translate to international platforms. What level does each Division compete at? Each of the four separate divisional levels works at a different level of competition. Though they all have similar sounding names, they each have their own flair and flavor, which makes them all exciting and diverse. These are driven by the rank categories that each encompasses. Here you’ll find a mix of a wide range of fencers, from Youth fencers who are at least 13 all the way up to Veteran fencers.

It’s challenging to meet a fencer who is at such a disparate age even though they might be at a similar level. It brings variety and interest to the competition. Division III Division III is for D, E, or U (unrated) fencers. Div 3 is a great place for less experienced fencers to compete beyond their local and regional level. This is an entrance into divisional competition, and it’s a positive, broad category. I personally like Division III and Division II because it gives less experienced fencers a “fair” battlefield. For a 15-year-old fencer with little experience competing nationally in Cadet or Junior categories is tough. There are many high-rated and ranked Cadets and Juniors who will be way above the reach of such fencers because there is no limit of the skill level in these age categories. These fencers can easily encounter a pool with a National and even a World Champion when they compete at a NAC. However, Division II and III are a totally different ball game.

Since there is no one above a D level, this category is especially great for observing fencers at various developmental levels. This category is mixed with fencers from Youth to Veteran, which brings it lots of energy and a surprising amount of strategic interest. It’s a wonderful category to learn in. My suggestion to all D and lower rated fencers is to go and experience this tournament at the National level, so try and qualify for it. Another thing regarding Division III is that there are no competitions for it outside of the National Championship. Sometimes some clubs will organize Division III tournaments, but they are rare. So if you are a Division III fencer (i.e., D and lower rated) my recommendation is to try and qualify for the national championship and definitely attend.

Division II Division II is for C, D, E, or U categories. Again, because unrated fencers can compete here, there’s a good broad mix of fencers included in this category. Fencers who have been competing locally can push to Div 2 when they’ve become stronger and are ready to take on the next level of challenge. Thanks to the inclusion of C-rated fencers but the exclusion of A- and B-rated fencers, Division II is a great place for fencers to push themselves harder, as the competition level is significantly higher than for Division III. Similar to Division III, I strongly recommend eligible fencers compete in these tournaments. Unlike Division III, there are many competitions for Division II. First of all, there are plenty of Division II ROC’s in different regions of the country.

Since points for ROC’s count for any fencer regardless of their region, fencers can really explore these ROC’s anywhere. Division IA Division IA,, often called an Open Division, is the only divisional category without a rating requirement. Though there is not a strictly defined level for this category, it is generally made up of many A-, B-, and C-rated fencers. It’s easiest to think of it as its name implies – closely related to Division I. The beauty of fencing in Division 1A in my eyes, is because it gives a chance for fencers of all levels to compete. Some very strong A-rated and nationally ranked fencers will find it very challenging in advanced rounds of competition, making this tournament fun for them. Less advanced fencers will have an opportunity to fence with similar level fencers as well as experience very high level fencing as well, when facing these A- and B-rated opponents.

Many of these fencers are competing internationally already or have aspirations to compete internationally. You’ll find the top rankings of US fencers here, including World Championship competitors and Olympians. The U.S. National Team is created from the top 4 fencers in Div 1, making it the highest level. There is, however, one disadvantage for Division I, and it is that most of the Division I competitions happen only in the context of National level tournaments, such as NACs, Division I Championship and July Challenge. I rarely saw a local tournament that is limited for Division I only, since usually it makes less sense for the organizers to create such a tournament.

How do Divisional categories fit into tournament structure? Summer Nationals will have all four divisions, but not every competition will. Different tournaments will offer different categories, depending on what the target of the competition is and what level it’s at – local, regional, or national. ROCs are going to heavily favor Div 1A, because it doesn’t require a rating and many fencers can compete at this level. This makes it attractive for the organizers of the competition, who need to appeal to as broad a range of potential competitors as possible for economic reasons. Div 2 ROC’s are rarer since it’s more restrictive and thus attracts fewer fencers, making it less viable economically for the organizers. When there is a Div 2 ROC, eligible fencers should go if possible.

Why Division categories are important Divisional categories offer fencers an incredible opportunity to push themselves while also finding attainable goals. The wider scope gives fencers the opportunity to compete against fencers who are potentially a better match than just competing by age.

The referee is. Always. Some people say that right of way is subjective. It is not. But since it is up to the referee to decipher the fencing phrase, some referees might see it differently than other referees. In their head, the referees are shaping the actions of each fencer into these phrases.

To understand right of way, you need to understand the referee’s perspective. It’s so incredibly important for fencers, because without understanding this you will always be stuck. Let’s dig into some specifics of referees and right of way. Good referees – consistency, feeling and listening Being a good fencing referee is hard. Good referees are always consistent. For example, in two cases of the same phrase they will award exactly the same touch. No matter when this phrase happened, not necessary even in your bout. It can happen in another bout, for example with your pool opponents. Lets forget the physical, mental, and stress aspects of this craft and focus only on the technical side. The actions in fencing are really fast, especially when it comes to a more advanced level. There are many phrase exchanges between fencers. They continuously go from attack to defence and their blade action is lightning fast. The craft of the referee is to really decipher what just happened. It is often said that referees judge the attack based on the feeling and the defense on the hearing.

{"id": "web-101329dc2a-2", "text": "ast. The craft of the referee is to really decipher what just happened. It is often said that referees judge the attack based on the feeling and the defense on the hearing. What does this mean? A good referee hears how many beats were made on a blade. Is that one? Two? Three? More? When they cannot see with their eyes (which happens more often than not), they can clearly hear with their ears. One beat – the attacker beat the blade of the defending fencer. Two beats – the defender took a parry, three beats – the attacker went for a counter parry. That’s the value of listening. The feeling is another thing – the referee “feels” the intention of the attacker. They see it in so many clues – the hand movement, the footwork, the whole body language that create this “feeling” of commitment to score in an attack. You also see it quite often (I would dare to say that definitely in every sabre bout and quite a lot in foil bouts) that both fencers will yell in a triumph when they go for some touches (for example, in a simultaneous attack). This is usually done to indicate to the referee that it was their intention to attack and score.

Remember from the definition of the right of way how important is intention of the last action? Since referees “feel” the phrase in addition to seeing it, it wouldn’t hurt to add a bit of assurance to their feeling, right? 🙂 Referees and a video replay review In high level tournaments, for example, starting from top 8 or 16 at USA National level tournaments (e.g., NACs, Nationals) and at International level competitions, you will see a video replay. The bout is recorded from touch to touch and the last phrase can be reproduced by the video. Oftentimes the referee will either retreat to the video review and analyse the last action, or there will be an appeal from one of the fencers on the last call that referee made. What happens during the video review is the referee, with the help of another referee who is responsible for the video part of officiating the bout, will review the action.

Sometimes what the main referee thought she saw on the strip will be clearer in a video review. Then she will make her final call, which cannot be appealed, based on that review. How fencers can adapt to the referee An essential part of fencing is understanding how the referee sees the phrase. It is very important to understand how the referee sees the phrase and thus decides on it. What they can separate and what they cannot. How they see the interruption, continuity, intent. While they all have “objective” definitions, referees might see them differently. One can separate and count in their head three blade beats in a secord, and another can do that with only two blade beats. One can see the difference in a start of attack that happen in half a second earlier than that of an opponent, and another in one quarter second. There are many more things that can be seen differently by the referees. These things might decide the winner for that bout!

One might have focused her attention on legs and another on the arms, for exactly the same action! Referees are humans and their feelings, attention and tiredness are the same as that of any of us. As I said before, a good referee will always be consistent. You need to adapt to that consistency. How? Look at things as opportunities instead of obstacles. For example, suppose you go for simultaneous attacks time and again. You think you start first but the referee consistently calls it quits. She clearly cannot separate your actions and your opponent’s actions. Instead of growing angry at the referee for not being “fair”, adapt to her! Change your action! Go for a beat instead of step-lunge, or do a fake attack and hit your opponent with a parry. By changing an action, you not only win the next point, but you will get a few other “intangible” points from your coach, teammates, referees and opponents that will see in you a smart person that knows how to change in the heat of the bout .

I don’t know if you can fully understand right of way unless you have been a referee at some point. At the end of the day, a fencer has to make an impression on the referee in order to be awarded right of way. You have to show the referee that your action was intentional, started first and went uninterrupted. What usually happens when young fencers start to ref, is that they are able to decipher actions that happen in front of them for the first time. It is truly a lightbulb moment. I should be clear here that I do not necessarily mean a paid job of being a referee. I mean being a referee at every possible occasion – in a class, in open fencing, during the warm up pre-competition bouts. Most coaches will start teaching their students to be referees. This is important.

It is only when they see the phrase, voice their explanation and interpretation, hear the arguments of their peers and classmates (which will be plenty!), that it all solidifies. Refereeing can be an act of humility in a good way. Young fencers have to learn why their understanding of a phrase was wrong, why and how they misinterpret who and do something about it in that or next touch. They have to hear the correction of the phrase from the coach or more experienced friend. It’s only then, with this kind of time, that the concept of the right of way will sink in their heads.

Refs rely on gut feelings. “Adding a bit of assurance” can be annoying, especially if done when obviously false. You also describe how refs “…see the interruption, continuity, intent.” I slice time finer than coaches, thus seeing interruptions they don’t – leading to disagreements.

I find it helps in tournaments, especially pool bouts, when you have an opportunity to watch the director of your opponents’ bouts, it allows you to see how accurate they will be; it also allows you to see what actions they might miss. Then you can plan your strategy for the bout to come, adjusting to the director’s viewpoint.

Jérémy Cadot (on the left) parries the flèche attack from Andrea Baldini during the final of the Challenge international de Paris. Execution [ edit ] To execute a parry, fencers strike the opponent's foible , or the area near the tip of the blade, with their forte , or the part of the blade near the bell guard (or handle) of the weapon. This deflects the opponent's blade away from them, protecting them and placing them in a good position to strike back. Approximations of the precise parries are made often during bouts, but are usually accurate enough to be classed as parries. In épée , because of absence of priority rules (see right-of-way), a parry can be classed as any deflection of the blade that prevents the opponent's attack from landing. Use [ edit ] The primary function of a parry is to prevent an opponent's attack from landing.

A parry is usually followed by a riposte , which is an attack back against the original attacker. More advanced fencers can, instead of immediately riposting after successfully taking a parry, initiate a prise de fer (\"taking of the blade\") in which they move the opponent's blade to a different position and then hit them. In foil and sabre , the rules governing the parry give it tactical significance as well: there is a rule known as priority , or \"right-of-way.\" The first fencer to commence an attack gains the priority. If the attack results in a successful hit, only the fencer who has the priority is awarded a touch (regardless of whether the fencer without right of way has made a touch). A successful parry causes the attack to fail, and hence the priority is transferred to the defender (who is now the attacker). Taking a parry, therefore, means that the attacker is in an awkward position (with their arm extended and sometimes off-balance), having just committed to attacking, and the defender has the priority, as well as the b", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parry_(fencing)", "title": "Parry (fencing) - Wikipedia", "tags": [], "date": ""}

Classification [ edit ] The classical eight lines of parries and attack in foil, according to Rondelle (1892) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] There are eight parries in the classical systems of épée and foil fencing. Parries are classified based on three attributes: 1) The direction of the blade in relation to the hand: up or down. 2) The position of the blade in relation to the fencing line: inside or outside. 3) The rotation of the wrist in the hand holding the weapon: supinated (palm up) or pronated (palm down). [ 3 ] The parries are numbered from one to eight, with the numbers often referred to by the old French terms: prime, seconde, tierce, quarte, quinte, sixte, septième, octave. For a right-handed fencer, the inside line is to the left, and the outside line is to the right; thus the parries prime , quarte , and septime deflect the opponent's blade to the left (inside), while the parries seconde , tierce , sixte , and octave deflect the opponent's blade to the right (", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parry_(fencing)", "title": "Parry (fencing) - Wikipedia", "tags": [], "date": ""}

The phrase \" counter-parry \" indicates a parry that is done in response to an opponent's parry (that is, to block the riposte which follows up the opponent's parry.) This is not to be confused with the contra- (or \"circular\") parry, in which a semicircular motion is used to make a parry from the opposite side from the attack. Because sabre parries defend against both cuts (attacks with the edge) as well as thrusts (attacks with the point), [ 4 ] the sabre parries are slightly different from the corresponding épée or foil parries; most notably the parry 5 (\"quinte\"), which defends against a head cut in sabre (an attack that is not allowed in foil or épée).

This includes the simple beat, a sharp rap on the opponent's blade, and the more complex bind, in which the fencer forces the opponent's blade to a different line. Composed of one move (a thrust, lunge or fleche), the simple attack is normally countered with a parry riposte, parrying (blocking or pushing aside) the opponent's blade and then attacking with this tactic. It can also be countered with a thrust in some situations. They are most effective when the distance between the fencers is small enough that the opponent cannot execute a parry riposte. Often fencers will try to close distance before mounting a simple attack to use this to their advantage. Sometimes, a fencer will make a simple attack and when the opponent parries, the fencer can then make a counter parry and riposte. Combined attack [ edit ] The combined attack (also known as the compound attack ) can be quite effective, despite its vulnerability to counter-attack. A fencer using the compound attack makes a feint, prompting the opponent to parry and makes an indirect attack in response.

Your opponent will try to parry it, but you will disengage and touch. The lines in fencing Parry [ edit ] Main article: Parry (fencing) A fencer deflects or blocks the opponent's blade with their own to defend themselves. This is usually followed by a riposte . The nine classical parries comprise basic bladework. The first parry that most fencers learn is quarte , known commonly as \"parry four\". Parries are named for the line that they defend from attack: parry four would defend line four, which is the high inside line. Parry and Riposte [ edit ] Main article: Riposte The parry riposte uses the strength of one's own blade to avoid the opponent's. After performing it, the fencer then counters the attack with a combined attack which would force the opponent to parry, allow you to counter parry the opponent's blade, and allow you to penetrate their next parry to win.

A fencer might choose to counterattack if they believe their opponent's attack will miss, or they might combine the counterattack with an evasive action (such as ducking beneath the opponent's attack) or simultaneously using their blade to deflect their opponent's attack during the counterattack (called a counterattack \"in opposition\"). Footwork [ edit ] Main article: Footwork (martial arts) The lunge position on the right, showing how much more distance can be obtained over the en garde stance In a fencing bout, a great deal depends on being in the right place at the right time. Fencers are constantly manoeuvring in and out of each other's range, accelerating, decelerating, changing directions and so on. All this has to be done with minimum effort and maximum grace, which makes footwork arguably the most important aspect of a fencer's training regimen. In fact, in the first half of the 20th century it was common practice to put fencers through six months to a year of footwork before they were ever allowed to hold a sword. This practice has now been largely abandoned. M", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_tactics", "title": "Fencing tactics - Wikipedia", "tags": [], "date": ""}

This practice has now been largely abandoned. Modern fencing tends to be quite linear. This is due to the width of the piste — no more than 2 m — and rules dictating a halt once fencers come into contact, pass each other, or turn their backs. These rules may reflect older dueling styles and the changing nature of weapons: Sideways movement, which was a common defense against an attack with a comparatively unwieldy weapon like the rapier , became an unreliable tactic when faced with smaller, much lighter weapons. In contemporary sport fencing defense by footwork usually takes the shape of moving either directly away from your opponent (out of his/her range) or directly towards him/her (making the attack \"overshoot\").

Fencers tend to stand somewhat side-on to the principal direction of movement (the fencing line ), leading with the weapon side (right for a right-hander, left for a left-hander). In this fencing stance the feet are a shoulder-width or more apart with the leading foot forward and the trailing foot at right angles to it. Finally, the knees are well bent and the center of gravity is kept midway between the heels. The fencer is now in a position where he/she is well balanced, able to use his/her leg muscles to generate rapid bursts of speed and change directions with comparative ease. In foil and épée , particularly, this stance decreases the vulnerable target area. Further, and more importantly, it maintains balance and ease of movement both forward and backward.

The most common way of delivering an attack in fencing is the lunge , where the fencer reaches out with his/her front foot and straightens his/her back leg. This maneuver has the advantage of allowing the fencer to maintain balance while covering far more distance than in a single step, yet still allowing a return to the more defensive fencing stance. Sometimes fencers do take the more \"natural\" kind of steps, where the back foot passes the front foot. These are usually referred to as cross-steps . While cross-steps do have the advantage of range and speed, they may put a fencer in an awkward and frequently unbalanced position mid-step. A somewhat exaggerated version of the cross-step, sometimes used to deliver an attack in foil or épée , is the flèche (\"arrow\" in French ). In the flèche, the fencer leans forward and takes a long running cross-step, generating most of the thrust with his/her front leg. Ideally, the hit delivered with a flèche should arrive as or just before the fencer's front foot hits the ground.

When (as often happens) the flèching fencer runs past the defender the defender is allowed to finish a defensive action, generally a riposte following a parry. In sabre forward cross-steps were prohibited in the 1990s, one of numerous efforts to increase the sport's popular appeal. This also removed distortions caused by the introduction of electronic scoring where sabre bouts degenerated to both parties charging to get the hit in first before passing their opponent and therefore ceasing to be a valid target. Variations and portions of the above movements can also be used by themselves. For example, a check-step forward is performed by moving the back foot as in a retreat, then performing an entire advance. This manoeuvre can trick your opponent into thinking that you are retreating, when in reality you are about to close distance. Other footwork actions include the appel ( French for \"call\"), which is a stomp designed to upset the opponent's perception of rhythm, and the ballestra , which is a \"hopping\" step occasionally used as a preparation for attacks (the back foot leaves the ground, while the front foot is still in mid-air; both feet come d", "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fencing_tactics", "title": "Fencing tactics - Wikipedia", "tags": [], "date": ""}

In general, Olympic fencing has put a premium on balance, speed, and athleticism in footwork, somewhat diluting orthodoxies regarding the classical stances and methods. To a degree, this has led to increasing resemblance between fencing footwork and that of other martial arts, with the significant caveat that a scoring \"touch\" requires almost no power behind the blow, only timing and the ability to manipulate distance. Tactical wheel [ edit ] The tactical wheel is a visual representation which can help people understand how and when many tactics should be used. It also illustrates how different fencing tactics can be countered. [ 1 ] It is also important to think ahead about an opponent's strategy, for expert players, even as far as four moves ahead, while minding your vulnerability to attack.
