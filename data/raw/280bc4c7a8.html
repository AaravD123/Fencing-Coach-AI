  So the rules of
  epee are, on the surface, much simpler than the </font><font color="#FF0000">priority</font> 
  <font color="#000080">
  rules of foil and sabre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
  like to say that epee is the only fencing weapon with <b>true</b>
  <a name="right-of-way">right-of-way</a>, which is enforced by the other fencer
  - do it wrong and they hit you!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you wonder why foil and sabre attacks are defined as
  they are in the rules, watch some epee --- moving forward without
  extending, starting too far out of distance,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>bent-arm attacks all will tend to get you hit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>In epee, a good attack should be delivered with a care to
  protecting your own target, more so than in foil or sabre, but with a
  technique that can be easily translated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>One of the earliest things you should be doing in a bout is
  watching for how your opponent delivers their attack - do they lift
  their hand, bend their wrist or elbow, and bring exposed target
  forward into your reach?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Often
  a good counterattack consists of placing your point in the way of a
  sloppy attack (its also a good move psychologically - the feeling
  of hitting the other fencers point&quot; with your hand/ wrist/
  forearm is demoralizing, and even if they just feel the contact, but no hit,
  early in an attack will often cause a very aggressive fencer to get
  more cautious).<o:p>

  This also means
  that you want to protect yourself when not attacking, as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A good epee on-guard should use the bell guard to protect at
  least the forearm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
  can try to get your entire arm behind it, but that involves
  straightening your arm to an extent that gives important leverage
  advantages to your opponent (their attacks intending to move your blade will be more
  effective) and also may cause them to stand too far out of your own reach (however, it also can back off a fencer who is
  having too easy a time reaching you!)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">.&nbsp;&nbsp;
  </span>You should be relaxed (avoid the death grip on your
  weapon),<b> </b>with your knees bent but your foot not too far out, front foot
  pointed forward, and with your weight balanced, ready to move forward
  or backward.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; Your back foot should be <b>under
  you -</b> one of the most common problems of fencers at many levels is that
  as they move forward, they &quot;drag&quot; their back foot, and it winds up too far behind
  them, severely limiting their lunging distance.&nbsp; <br class="style1">
  <br class="style1">
  </span>Some fencers
  protect themselves by keeping their arms back well away from their
  opponent's reach;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>this approach
  is workable but will take considerably more practice to perfect.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Often, the basic strategy with this stance is to wait for, or to provoke, an attack, parry
  strongly with blade control during a close of distance, and deliver a riposte
  with no or minimal release of the blade.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Attacks must be quick, still with extension as the first step 
  (&quot;lead with the point!&quot;), with good supporting footwork and
  very good point control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Look
  for this style - incomplete training will leave more openings for you than most
  other approaches:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>parries
  may be predictable and avoidable, or released much too early and
  vulnerable to a quick counterattack;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>the on-guard arm may be closer than the fencer realizes, and can 
  possibly be
  reached with a quick attack;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the point control may be lacking, and a deep
  counterattack into the body will work because the fencer consistently
  misses their first shot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
  well-trained fencer with this defensive style, on the other hand, will entice
  you in to attack what appear to be obvious openings and then, with
  your arm and feet now fully committed, take control of your blade and hit you
  at will.<o:p>&nbsp; Attack these fencers shallowly, to the arm and front edge 
  of the shoulder, possibly the thigh.

  </span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt"> <font color="#000080"> is important - many fencers square off, with
  the back shoulder swung somewhat in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>They may be comfortable this way, but there are a few things
  that you must consider.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First,
  the classical position of having the back shoulder way back was
  developed by people who were worried about loss of life - it wasnt
  invented on a whim.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Having
  your shoulder around presents more target to a deep attack - a lesser problem if you can train yourself to pivot away from such an
  attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But there is a
  much more important consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Try this - take up a squared position, and extend fully
  to touch a wall.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Now swing your 
  shoulder into classic position and extend, and you'll see that you actually 
  have to back up to fit a full extension between you and the wall - there is a decided reach advantage from the classical position!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Of course, many fencers with &quot;bad body position&quot; swing their shoulders 
  around<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>to deliver an attack, but many dont, unaware of the distance
  they are giving up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There are 
  also balance advantages getting into and out of lunges from the classic 
  position as well, if the back arm is used properly, but we wont go into those here.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  </span></p>
	<p class="auto-style1" align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
	<o:p>
    Consider blade position as well - if you opponent attacks by first going 
	after your blade, a lifted point makes it easier for them.&nbsp; Best 
	position against blade attackers is with your point aimed right at, or just 
	alongside, their bell guard.</o:p></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt"><font color="#000080">What
  do you look at while you're fencing?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That
  varies - some fencers watch their opponents eyes, some pick a
  potential target and focus on it, some focus on the back-up
  target that they will switch to if an initial stroke misses, some
  dont feel like they focus on anything in particular at all.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>What best sustains concentration and produces the best results
  is apparently different even among the best fencers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Remember, though, that if your approach is to lock
  your eyes on what you want to hit, some of your opponents are watching
  your eyes and may be forewarned.<o:p>

  strategy is mostly a blend of three actions - attacks, defense with
  ripostes, and counterattacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
  truly good strategy should be a blend of all three, but most fencers
  will settle into an approach that uses one action more than the others.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The most important, and often the hardest, aspect of
  any strategy is the concentration and focus you need to find, follow,
  and hit target when target is available.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>You need to be able to process information - at first, simple
  things picked up in training, then competition-based follow-up information
  (you probably need a trained observer to tell you what youve done wrong and
  how to correct it), then competition-day advice from a coach before or during 
      a bout (youll
  find, early on, that such advice is more confusing than useful -
  thats pretty normal).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
  you have the type of coach who can sit with you alongside the strip
  and analyze the fencers in your pool, take advantage of it - at first,
  youll find that it doesnt seem to help much, but eventually it
  will, and much later it will make it possible for you to do it
  yourself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Next, youll be able to 
      step on to the strip with some sort of plan specific to certain opponents 
      - sometimes it will work, sometimes not, and youll have to decide if the 
      failure is due to a strategic problem or to an execution
  problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There will be a
  frustrating period during which youll get flashes of insight just
  after a bout (oh, I should have done <b>this!!!!</b>), but that stage for
  most people leads to the ability to think, strategize and adjust
  during the actual bout.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So,
  for many experienced people, bad days will be lapses in focus
  rather than failures in techniques.<o:p>

  A
  fencer whose main strategy is to attack must continually look for

  the basic on-guard position of your opponent - what hand and arm

  youre not going to hit them with your eyes - the openings have to
  be in respect to your blade and point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
  With some point control, attacks that can be delivered directly are easiest 
  (aim early for best results, especially if you're just learning): extend, aim, 
  and use footwork to move the point to target.<br class="style1">

  around that same corner.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  best angulation is delivered with a normal thrust and a movement
  outward with the hand <strong>during</strong> the attack - if you bend your wrist to angulate at the beginning,
  it provides immediate target to a counterattack and
  too much warning of your intent. </font></span><span style="font-size: 14.0pt; color: black; mso-spacerun: yes">

  flicks are best perfected in practice on either a dummy or a
  well-padded partner - badly-done flicks are brutal, and I would not
  recommend numbing your opponents arm as a sporting strategy (be
  aware that some fencers do use it as just that, however).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Both of these types of attacks can usually be defended with a slight
  adjustment of the bell guard position, rather than a blade-on-blade

  away than it feels.&nbsp; </span>Remember,
  however, that attacks to the leg or foot open your own arm to
  counterattacks, and so are of limited use against someone who usually
  counterattacks.&nbsp; A high feint with a drop to low target is more likely
  to work against fencers who are trying to defend, or who back away but
  are slow removing that front foot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Look, too, for your opponents balance point - if their
  weight is primarily on one foot or the other, this will affect how
  well they move - if on their front foot, they will retreat faster than
  they advance, and vice versa for the rear foot.<o:p>&nbsp; And if their rear 
  foot is not underneath them (once moving, many fencers &quot;drag&quot; that foot), 
  their lunging distance will be compromised.&nbsp; Also, if they are
  constantly moving, is there a pattern or rhythm to the movement that you can take advantage of?</o:p></font></span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><o:p>

  </span>You may be able to take advantage of this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Remember, however, that in many cases you may <b>want</b> them
  to actually parry - the contact will often cause a break in their

  </span>A foil-like feint and disengage that evades the parry completely will often cause them to
  keep trying to parry, and that may block your disengage, especially if
  the opponent has earlier foil training.<span style="mso-spacerun:

  is that foil-trained fencers will sometimes parry, release your blade (in 
  foil, they have right-of-way at this point and don't have to worry about what 
  you'll do then), and
  riposte, leaving you an opportunity for a quick remise into the

  your opponent counterattacks, is it coming from a predictable angle?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>You may be able to <strong>adjust your hand position</strong> so that their
  counterattack is diverted from your target, or just to cover the
  target that youre opening during your attacks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  Think of attacking <strong>through their counterattack.</strong>&nbsp;
  </span>Use your opponent's scored points to tell you what you are showing
  to them - if they keep hitting a particular area of your target, you must be leaving it open.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Many counterattackers have good focus and point control;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>one of the common mistakes made against
  counterattackers is attempting an attack to a
  target that is much too deep (far away)- youre trying to reach the body and
  getting hit on the arm as you try it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Against many counterattackers, you may need to attack the
  blade as a first step, disturbing their focus and forcing them to take time to regain
  their point control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes
  a simple beat
  will do this, especially if executed (as they are supposed to be) as
  an early-to-middle part
  of your extension, so that your rebound from the beat puts your point very
  close to their target while they are recovering from the beat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Beats in epee are less effective at actually opening target than in
  foil, usually, and can be tricky to deliver against a blade thats
  almost parallel to yours - you may need to angulate the blade
  slightly to make good contact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beats
  can be from the inside out (attacks up the arm are good from this),
  from the outside in (easier against an opposite-handed fencer), up
  from underneath (can be quite disorienting to an opponent, but also
  harder for the attacker to recover from), or down from above (better
  on a grounded strip, because the point may be driven into the floor).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Attacks on the blade may also provide you with enough time to
  allow you to attack to your opponents body, or may offset a reach
  disadvantage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
  important to remember, when you are first starting, that its <b>target</b>,
  not the other blade, that is your first consideration - swinging at
  the other weapon just &quot;because it's there&quot; wont score many points 
  and can be a disadvantage in several ways.<o:p>

  Fleching itself is difficult to do until you have good control of your 
  foot-body interaction - you need to be able to step over without swinging your 
  torso around.&nbsp; Make sure that your back foot's push is preparatory, just 
  shifting your weight, and 
  the primary push comes off your front foot, or the move is just a big step.&nbsp;
  </span>You also will need to practice how to deal with the results of an 
  unsuccessful fleche attack - for most people new to them, running past is the best 
  follow-up;&nbsp; later, a halt at infighting range may be better.<o:p>&nbsp; 
  Also consider the <strong>side</strong> you fleche to - a move to the opponent's chest side 
  provides more follow-up opportunities for you but responses from them more 
  likely to hit you;&nbsp; 
  a move behind them can limit both, but you can practice continued attack 
  options, while your opponents may not have practiced their response options.

  A

  </span>How do you do this without actually initiating your own attack?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Keep moving, both forward and backward, and try to force them

  the arm, which will keep them from settling too much into a comfort

  riposte, riding down it to target.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  will have to bend or lift their arm to accomplish this), and then
  release.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In this

  </span>They require good finger control, and as a practice weapon they
  can help you develop improved point control.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Many fencers find the weapon's balance point, which is almost in the
  hand, to be much more comfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>French grips can be shifted forward and backward to provide
  additional reach - shifting back beyond a certain point affects finger
  control (attacks tend to become more limited) and ability to defend,
  and requires a very strong yet controlled hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The hand and forearm are a bit more protected than with most
  pistol grips, as long as it is not held too far back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Attacks on the blade tend to be harder to recover from with a
  French grip - held properly and extended, leverage is a trifle worse
  than with other grips.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; It's b</span>etter

  negates many of the Frenchs advantages, and in many major ways

  fair to lump all pistol-type grips under one heading, but Ill try
  to keep this general enough to justify it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Pistol grips, which come in a dizzying variety of styles and
  sizes, generally provide set grip points for the back fingers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This can strengthen most aspects of epee fencing requiring
  power, especially defense, but the use of the back fingers at the wrong times can
  interfere with precise point placement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Since point control is so critical to epee, this tends to be
  unlearned quicker than in foil, where even experienced fencers
  deliver full-grip slashes with the wrist and forearm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Still, point control may be slower to come with a pistol
  grip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Some grips put the
  edge of the last finger actually below the edge of bell guard and therefore vulnerable, and the
  hand and forearm are slightly more open, although they dont
  necessarily appear to be to an opponent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It generally isnt possible to shift your hand position much
  and increase reach.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
  balance of the weapon is out the blade a bit, which makes the weapon seem
  heavier (especially when you're first getting used to it) and may dip the point, although fencers generally adjust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>The shorter grips make the arm/wrist positions of infighting
  easier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What sometimes
  happens in clubs is that each member settles on a grip that they feel
  comfortable with, which is good, but when weapons fail and fencers
  borrow, it can be a disadvantage, even though the differences are often
  more psychological than actual.<o:p>&nbsp; If you are using a pistol grip
  properly, it shouldn't be too difficult to shift from one type to another.</o:p>

  </span>There are very few people who can properly teach the technique

  first thing to remember is that its hard to in-fight if you cant
  get your point between you and your opponent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Usually some attack that clears out and controls the other
  blade is best, although a deep attack - that misses - and a
  counterattack - that misses - often leads to unintended close
  quarters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its best if
  you can get the point between your bodies;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>trying to hit with an outside angulation is very hard unless
  theres a huge height difference.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If you are closer than an epee length, and the points
  between you, your hand cant be between you - proper in-fighting
  involves moving the hand out and placing the point in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It may involve raising the hand above the head, dropping it
  low, or pulling the elbow out or back past the ribs;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>while youre doing it, though, your hand grip is important.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A relaxed grip will allow you to snap the point to
  available target, but a tight grip makes a jab necessary, which is
  slower, harder to land properly, and sometimes brutal.<o:p>

        more than once of late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If you
  step off the side of the strip with a single foot (and it has to touch clearly 
        beyond the sideline), a halt is called
        and you get backed a meter from where you started the action, and

        after your foot touches out-of-bounds) on your part don't count.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>If you use offensive actions that carry you past your
  opponent, you need to pass them before stepping off to not be penalized the
        meter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
        </span>Also, if you step off in the middle of a fencing
  action, once your foot hits the ground off the strip, a halt
  should be called and you can no longer hit your opponent (you can hit
  them with the action that carried you off, however, subject to the
  referees interpretation), but they have a beat of fencing time to
  hit you.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If a halt is called because a fencer has stepped off
  the side, the meter loss should be applied
  when the two are reset - it is important to know <u>why</u> the halt
  was called in such circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Under some circumstances, when a fencer near the end line steps
  off the strip, this meter penalty may back them off the strip and give
  the other fencer a touch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another
  rule, rarely applied, provides a yellow card for the fencer that jumps
  off the strip to avoid being hit.<o:p>

  that there are some opponents you do <u>not</u> want to do this with:
  some fencers become wildly unpredictable when cornered, and may do
  things that you are not prepared to deal with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>So who <u>do</u> you want to back up?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Fencers who fade away from your attacks while counterattacking, especially
  if they have more reach than you do, are one type of opponent you want
  backed up - they need room to fade through, and being too far
  back takes  that away.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Another,
  less obvious opponent is the thinker, whose attacks are well-planned
  and who takes their time preparing them - this type of fencer is much
  more likely to rush when feeling cornered.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>And <u>how</u> do you back an opponent up?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Sometimes its a simple matter of continually advancing, and
  sometimes you need to attack in a way that keeps you protected but
  makes them retreat.</font></span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:black"><o:p>

  you have no reason to do otherwise, stay in the middle of the strip -
  on some strips in crowded venues, that will keep you from hitting
  off-strip objects, including referees.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It will make you less likely to step off as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>On grounded strips, fencing near the edge increases the chances
  of an off-strip floor hit that may be counted against you (yes,  they may be counted <u>for</u> you, but you dont want that, do you?), and
  stepping partly off a raised strip can turn your ankle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, many
  opponents will mount fleche attacks that carry past you, and most of
  them will have a preferred side to fleche to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Because of the sideline rules, you want these fencers off the
  strip as soon as possible during these actions, so decide which side
  theyre going to and move to that side.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Referees may be slow to call halts when a fencer
  closes and fences alongside their opponent, but they have little
  choice if one fencer is off the strip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>It may be a good idea to request clarification of calls from
  the referee to remind them of what they should be watching for under
  these circumstances - a simple question of, Were they off the
  strip?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>when a touch is
  scored may get the refs keeping their eyes out for just that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Keep in mind that, under crowded conditions, fencing the
  sideline may also force the opponent to fleche at an angle that they
  are not used to, to avoid off-strip objects like the scoring table - this can work for or
  against you, depending upon how well you can adapt if they have to
  crowd you while passing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
  fleching is one of <u>your</u> primary moves, you may want to try to
  move laterally (if your opponent will move over with you) to give yourself more room to do it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  figure out why.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Opposite-handed 
  fencers may move to their outsides to consciously close off
  some angles, but often its a subconscious reaction to the change in
  hand positions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If a
  fencer moves to the side and you dont want them to, you may want to
  fence them diagonally on the strip (if you can do this and not step
  off) - often theyll move back in rather than fence in that
  unfamiliar configuration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You

  As in all fencing weapons, the distance between opponents
  is critical.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Epee fencers
  tend to be farther separated than sabre fencers but less so than foil
  fencers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How far apart?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>That varies, based upon a lot of factors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>First, you want to stay out of your opponents easy reach,
  which depends upon your opponents height, arm length, quickness,
  and depth of extension and footwork.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Now you know why experienced fencers, when first
  on-strip with someone they dont know, keep quite a distance from
  each other for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Second, you
  want to be in a position from which you can score, if possible, with
  the simplest and quickest footwork.<o:p>&nbsp; So there are two critical 
  distances in a bout:&nbsp; theirs and yours.&nbsp; You shouldn't just settle into 
  theirs without expecting to get hit.&nbsp; If you move into your opponent's 
  distance, either attack or get out - unless you are purposely trying to provoke an 
  attack from them.</o:p></font></span></p>
  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt"><font color="#000080">How
  is distance determined?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Ideally,
  it should be based on how far the other fencer is from your target,
  but judging that is difficult for beginners and problematical for even
  many experienced fencers.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Many of your opponents will rely on the position of
  the two blades to determine distance, a fact that you can use
  strategically - such opponents can be drawn in by pulling your blade
  in, or held more at bay by extending.<o:p>

  counterattack, you may need to back them up and use the rear line to

  can use the staying away strategy also - advance to meet your opponent
  to give you maximum withdrawal room.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A good counterattack under these circumstances is usually
  delivered early (before you have moved out of reach, obviously) in
  such a way that if you miss, you dont get hit by the attack.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>A good extension, body position, and focus of the point are
  all critical.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Against an opponent using this tactic, it is possible
  to fence in what is called counter-time - you start your initial
  attack, divert and/or control the counterattack while still moving
  forward, then hit with a riposte.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>That sounds a lot easier than it is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  </span>You may find your opponent making body contact - in epee, often
  the contact has to be very obvious for a halt to be called, and a
  fencer pretty much has to clearly move their opponent with the contact for a
  yellow card to be imposed (this rule, based partly upon bad interpretation of 
  the original French, allows a wide range of application).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Close-contact
  fencing should be practiced, like any other aspect of fencing, during

  able to hit an opponent who steps in, or who purposely fleches by at
  close distance will discourage the move.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

  fleching, or by holding your ground against a very aggressive

  This can often depend upon the background of the fencer: sabre
  fencers tend to use a quick rhythm with little patience; foil fencers
  may wait to attack, but their rhythms within actions tend to be quite
  fast and may be improperly controlled; epee fencers should be able to
  fence at any of these rhythms, but any individual will have a
  preferred rhythm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
  not unusual for epee fencers to start a bout in a slow, deliberate
  rhythm that speeds gradually up as the fencers get used to each other.<o:p>

  RHYTHM AS A STRATEGY.</span></b><span style="font-size: 14.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>You can sometimes use an opponents rhythms against them: if
  you know that your opponent is primarily a sabre fencer (especially if
  they are fencing both weapons in the same event), you may want to
  speed up your own rhythm - this will only work if you can keep your
  technique and, more importantly, point control at the faster rhythm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Making a sabre fencer fence at a sabre speed often interferes
  with their epee technique - their hands will tend to cut rather than
  thrust.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Foil fencers can be fenced with broken rhythm - fence
  into their parry-riposte pattern and then remise, or attack with
  a break in the middle - they will riposte or attack when they should
  be retreating or defending.<o:p>
  </o:p>

  <p class="MsoNormal" align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt"><font color="#000080">It
  may greatly benefit you to slow an opponent down - a speedy foe may
  overwhelm you and break your focus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This is not easy - the best way, if you can do it, is to
  establish your point in the way of their forward movements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>This can be dangerous - holding your weapon in their way leaves
  you vulnerable to controlling actions on the blade (but not every
  opponent will do these, or they may do them so badly that the actions are
  easily avoided), and quick counterattacks into attacks may not be easy
  to control - look for repeating patterns and ways to intercept
  their incoming target with your point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>If a fast-moving fencer continually gets hit or almost hit
  repeatedly, they will tend to go slower.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
  </span>Be careful that you dont slow down too much - its one
  thing to be cautious, another to be asleep.<o:p>

in general, one should practice at varied rhythms so you get used to
them - an advanced fencer can force you into particular rhythms, but you
can minimize the advantage it gives them if you've practiced at different paces.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also, practice changing rhythms - fast-slow, or
regular-irregular.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
change-ups are common strategic approaches in a wide variety of sports,
and they work here too.&nbsp; Be careful of training while listening to music, 
since it can subconsciously lock you into particular rhythms.<br class="style1">
<br class="style1">
A common rhythm change that you have to be ready for is an immediate attack at 
the &quot;fence&quot; command from someone who has been fencing slowly.&nbsp; This kind of 
surprise attack can be very effective if used judiciously.&nbsp; If you do it 
regularly, it's not much of a surprise.<br class="style1">

  the most difficult of the analytical skills for a fencer is to be able to
  figure out what is going on <b><i>while</i></b> it is going on.&nbsp; Why did
  that attack fail?&nbsp; Why did you just get hit?&nbsp; Are there patterns
  being shown by your opponent?&nbsp; How is your opponent's strategy changing
  as the score changes?&nbsp; Have you tried the same basic move too many
  times?&nbsp; Have you given up on something too easily?&nbsp; Have you stuck
  with something much too long?&nbsp; This is a skill
  that is built up over time, first by relying on a coach's eyes to see what you
  and other fencers are doing right or wrong, then to planning your response 
  before a bout, then
  to understanding just after a bout, then to gradually being able to do it
  &quot;on the fly.&quot;&nbsp; You occasionally need to be able to analyze the 
  tendencies of a referee this way as well - what actions are they seeing or not 
  seeing?&nbsp; That is much more critical in foil and sabre.</font></span></p>

  opponents with whom you are unfamiliar.&nbsp; You should be able to watch them
  in other bouts and see tendencies and techniques that you can use to plan your
  approach to them.&nbsp; Look for repetitive hand patterns, preferred parries
  or counters, &quot;tells&quot; before attacks, whether they engage or
  withdraw, etc.&nbsp; Of course, they may fence you differently than the
  others, but that too is something you have to consider.&nbsp; Do they fence
  badly at first and then improve?&nbsp; Is their opponent just too different
  from you for their responses to be predictive?&nbsp; Are they so good that
  they can to
  do just enough to win against lesser opponents without revealing very much
  (that paranoia alone may be useful to notice)?&nbsp; You will probably do
  better if each time you step on the strip you have some idea of what sort of
  fencing you'll be facing.&nbsp; And you might want to take notes, or have
  someone do it for you - build yourself an opponents' database.&nbsp; If you're 
  planning on competing for a while, such a written record of opponents, along 
  with notes on your own bouts, can be very useful.&nbsp; Observing referee 
  tendencies with other fencers can be very useful, more so for foil and sabre.</font></span></p>

  important attributes a fencer can have, since very few get truly intensive
  analytical coaching.&nbsp; Develop the ability to decide what you are doing well and what
  needs improvement, what strategies are your best alternatives and what are the
  best back-ups if your primary approach isn't working (and you'll need to
  decide if something isn't working because of something your opponent is doing
  or because of some failing on your part).&nbsp; Being able to focus on
  specific moves during practice sessions is tough if you don't know what moves
  need to be worked on.&nbsp; For some, those skills will need to be drilled in,
  over and over;&nbsp; for some, they need to be part of sparring, worked in in
  the context of actual fencing time;&nbsp; many will need a combination.</font></span></p>

  competition experience involves the phrase, &quot;But it works!&quot;&nbsp; Almost everyone that
  starts does some things &quot;wrong,&quot; but there's something odd about 
  many &quot;wrong&quot; things:&nbsp; such a style may produce a lot
  of success, especially against other inexperienced opponents but even against
  experienced fencers who don't expect &quot;wrong&quot; actions and haven't
  been taught how to take advantage of them.&nbsp; A beginner may have success on the local level, even the regional level, but there will be
  some opponents they just will not be able to beat and a plateau of ability
  that they will have problems moving beyond.&nbsp; Being coached from a
  &quot;wrong&quot; style to a &quot;right&quot; style almost always involves a
  frustrating interim where nothing seems to work and success seems impossible,
  and it is during this interim that many fencers give up and find something
  else to do.&nbsp; Frustration may also come from fellow club members adjusting 
  to the wrong actions - the main reason they are wrong is because they can 
  easily be countered.&nbsp; Just keep in mind that usually having success with a faulty
  approach implies physical gifts that will eventually make proper technique <i>
  very</i> successful.</font></span></p>

  Drills can build coordination.&nbsp; My personal recommendation is drills
  that duplicate actual fencing as closely as possible - for instance, doing
  footwork drills with a weapon in hand, or handwork drills with variations that
  require some choice in response, such as practicing two parry-riposte
  combinations and allowing your partner to choose which of two (or some other
  limited number) attacks to launch.</o:p></font><b>

  Useful but not absolutely necessary, the ability to deliver power through your
  weapon can greatly determine which strategies will work and which techniques
  to apply.&nbsp; Power can be overused and can result in brutality, so caution
  is advised.&nbsp; As a beginner, developing an effective power game will be
  more difficult than other strategic foundations (power can make it hard to
  develop the finesse needed for good point control), but if you stay at it you
  will become very difficult to deal with.&nbsp; Power often comes from the 
  technique involved in proper leverage.</font></span></p>

  </span><font color="#000080">Like any sport, you train your reactions in fencing,
  and your
  raw ability to recognize an action and react to it has a basic
  foundation that can be heightened, but this always has limitations in the
  individual.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Slow reflexes
  can be compensated for by early recognition, planning, and
  manipulation of distance.&nbsp; Also, technique training can help - moves done
  correctly, under control, are usually smaller and therefore quicker - you
  can react late but get to the parry-riposte stage faster with a small, controlled
  parry.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

</o:p>
 A slight squeeze of your grip during your attack will move your point
quite a way from where you were aimed (if the point drops at the end of an
extension, or rebounds sharply, you're squeezing, probably with the back
fingers).&nbsp; If your hand is cramping, or you feel the need to shake it
between points, you're holding on too hard - and if you're holding on too hard,
point control is limited.</font>
