   <FONT SIZE=5>End of the Line:</FONT></A><font size="5"> The purpose of this drill is to practice a variety of parries, and it requires two fencers.  One fencer (A) stands on guard, back foot against a wall, foil in hand (mask on).  The second fencer (B) finds her/his lunging distance.  Fencer B then takes his/her guard and 
				proceeds to attack in a line of her/his choice.  It is fencer A's job to parry the incoming attack and riposte immediately (fencer B will recover).  Note that if fencer A chooses a poor parry, fencer B should make the touch (i.e. it should be a committed attack).  Once the fencers become comfortable with both roles in the drill, an additional level of complexity should be added by allowing the attacking fencer to perform actions on the blade prior to the attack.
   <BR><BR>
   				</font>
   <A NAME="IR">
   <FONT SIZE=5>Immediate Riposte:</FONT></A><font size="5"> The purpose of 
this drill is very simple--to teach the student to riposte <I>immediately</I> 
after the parry.  In this case immediately should be defined as: before the 
opponent can even think about a recovery or a remise.  This is a very simple 
drill and can be executed in any line.  Moreover, it should be practiced in 
all lines whenever possible.  <BR><BR>
Start out of distance, with an aggressor and a defender.  The aggressor should 
perform an advance-lunge to either the high line or low line as previously 
decided.  The defender then performs his/her choice of parry, and ripostes 
(direct by detaching the blade, direct along the blade, or indirect, but not 
compound) immediately.  The defender's goal is to make a successful riposte, 
while the agressor, his attack having been foiled, attempts to recovery to 
his guard as quickly as possible to avoid the riposte.  Note: the defender must
<I>not</I> lunge with her/his riposte. <BR><BR>
Variations:  This drill can be performed in many variations.  Possible ideas 
are to have the attacker add feints on the attack, to start in distance, or 
to perform actions on the blade prior to the attack.  However, these should be 
saved for more advanced students as the additional complexity detracts from the
focus on the immediate purpose of the drill--an unhesitating riposte. <BR><BR>
The general form of this exercise was written in 1932 by Luigi Barbasetti as: 
"The master makes a strong thrust and then recovers rapidly, whereupon the 
pupil, without lunging, executes a riposte before the instructor can recover."
   <BR><BR>
   				</font>
   <A NAME="OaR">
   <FONT SIZE=5>Openings and Responses:</FONT></A><font size="5"> 
By now the student should be familiar with the 3 main openings: the invitation, the 
engagement, and the extension.  They should also be familiar with the 3 simple 
attacks: the straight thrust, the disengagement and lunge, and the glide.  For 
each of the openings, one of the simple attacks supplies the most direct/efficient 
means for taking advantage of the opening.  For the invitation, it is the straight 
thrust (make sure to close the line!), for the engagement, the disengagement and 
lunge, and for the extension it is the glide.  However, it takes some time to 
internalize those relationships, so the purpose of this drill is to meet each opening 
with the correct response. <BR><BR>
This drill should first be done from an immobile guard.  First, fencers A and B will 
guard in 3rd at fencer A's lunging distance.  Fencer B will then offer one of the 3 
openings, either inviting in 3rd, engaging fencer A's blade in 3rd, or extending 
to the high line.  <I>As soon as</I> the opening is offered, fencer A will respond 
with the appropriate simple attack in the high line and touch.  After a certain 
amount of time they should switch roles.<BR><BR>
Obviously the above is a bit simple, so let us extend it.  Now, still from a stationary 
guard, allow fencer B to choose the starting line at random.  That is, fencer B will 
invite or engage in any of the 4 lines, or extend to either the high line or the low 
line.  Fencer A will respond with an appropriate simple attack.  Switch roles. 
<BR><BR>
Finally, to complete the drill, do it 'in time with mobility'.   That is, allow fencer B to 
control the movements as well as the timing of the opening.  Fencer B will advance 
and retreat at will, and fencer A should maintain an appropriate lunging distance.  
At will, fencer B offers an opening, and fencer A should <I>immediately</I> 
respond with a correct attack that is in time with the opening, appropriate for the 
opening, and at a proper distance.<BR><BR>
				Obviously this can continue to be extended until it eventually resembles an actual 
assault.  A couple simple extensions are: first, to allow fencer B to attempt to 
parry-riposte, and second to change the distance so that fencer A is using an 
advance lunge, possibly with a feint, to which fencer B can respond with his/her 
choice of parry, which fencer A must evade and continue through for the touch.

<p style="margin-left: 20px;line-height:150%; margin-right:20px">
<font face="High Tower Text">"Some of the most 
interesting actions in fencing with the foil are those which aim to divert your
 adversary's blade from the line of attack or get a wider opening.  To execute
them successfully, it is extremely necessary to give these actions most 
careful study.  They are absolutely essential and you must master them, since 
faulty execution will but subject you to danger.  The tactics are simple and 
normal.<BR><BR>
The Actions Against the Blade of an Opponent present a number of possibilities,
 particularly as the thrusts are generally made horizontally.  While it is 
true that the defender has the advantage, because the attacker is able to find 
only small openings, it is also true that the attacker has the means of 
enlarging the existing openings and of increasing their number. <BR><BR>
We shall limit ourselves to a few brief suggestions since a manual at best can 
give only the fundamentals.  Nevertheless, these suggestions should lead to 
more intensive training in the play of the foil--a play which results in the 
conflict of two wills, each seeking to thwart the other by means not unlike 
those of wrestling." <BR>

<font face="High Tower Text">In the fall semester we successfully built a vocabulary of fencing actions.  You
are now all familiar with advances, retreats, lunges, appeal, cross-steps, jump
backs and forwards, and maybe even fleches.  You know the four lines, the four
simple attacks, simple, circular, semi-circular and ceding parries, you've done
single and double feints, disengagements, and deceives, blade seizures,
pressures, changes of engagement, transports, envelopments, expulsions, simple,
change, and circular beats, disarms, counter-parry ripostes, simple ripostes,
compound ripostes . . .  What you may not be as comfortable with is when to use
all those actions, and how to respond to your opponent's openings.  Now that we
understand the basic mechanisms of these actions I want to begin putting them in
context and looking at how to apply them.  As we go we will also add more
details and variations to the executions of the actions, and add in new actions,
such at the counter attacks.  By the end of the semester I hope to confront you
with many technical and tactical situations so that you can develop a more
complete understanding of how and when to use the actions we learned last
fall--then you will be able to really start fencing.  Oh, and I want to give you
the chance to get lots of practice so that the actions you already know will
flow smoothly and naturally. </font>

<font face="High Tower Text">Working with this semester's goal, the lesson plans will be a bit different.
Rather than working on specific actions and set sequences, each lesson we will
approach a different opening presented by an opponent.  We will develop a
response to that opening and then continue to build a sequence by responding to
that response, etc.  As we get into the swing of things I expect you all to
start seeing the possible responses and begin making the sequences yourselves,
rather than me making them for you.

"If it were possible to achieve the ideal of fencing with the foil, parries 
would be unnecessary.  All the fencer would have to do would be to anticipate 
correctly the direction of his opponent's final thrust, and to forestall it 
with a coup d'arret.  The old Italian method was built on this principle of 
the ideal art of fencing, and a weapon for serious encounters was always used, 
never a practice spada.  The defense was only a cleverly devised and cunningly 
applied means, which led to the execution of an action into the opponent's 
tempo."<BR>
