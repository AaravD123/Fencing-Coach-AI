    "text": "USA Fencing Rules for Competition ii Version: January 2023 Foreword This American Version of the international rules governing fencing competitions is translated and adapted from the 2001 French edition published by the FIE and incorporates changes made by the FIE Congresses and adopted by the USA Fencing Board of Director s through August 2022. Unless otherwise noted here or in the USA Fencing Operations Manual, these rules apply to fencing competitions in the United States. The publication in electronic format with year and revision dating at the bottom of each page is intended to simplify the incorporation of future changes to the rules. Updates to the rules will be made available as approved on the USA Fencing website. The United States Fencing Association, Inc. doing business as USA Fencing (founded as the Amateur Fencers League of America in 1891) is a not -for-profit, tax -exempt organization primarily engaged in increasing participation in the sport of fencing. Membership in USA Fencing, in an appropriate category, is open to anyone who has an interest in fencing. USA Fencing is the official governing body for amateur fencing activities in the United States, and is so recognized by the Unites States Olympic & Paralympic Com mittee and the International Fencing Federation (FIE). Accordingly, the authority to enact, amend, and repeal the rules governing amateur fencing in the United States rests solely with the Board of Directors of USA Fencing. As a matter of policy, USA Fenci ng normally follows the technical rules enacted for the sport by the FIE, with occasional minor exceptions that are duly announced. The rules for fencing, as set forth in this book, therefore apply to all USA Fencing championships and nationally -rated comp etitions, and, unless exceptions have been announced in advance by the appropriate authorities, apply also to all events scheduled by any Section or Division of USA Fencing, or held under USA Fencing auspices. \u201cUSA Fencing\u201d is a registered trademark of the United States Fencing Association, Inc.

    "text": "USA Fencing Rules for Competition iii Version: January 2023 Preface This American edition incorporates the most recent FIE rules changes, using terms commonly used in American fencing. Some changes of form have been made to increase the clarity of the text, without altering the original intent. At times, a note is provided in text that is boxed off in order to explain application of a certain rule. The 2018 update involved substantial change s throughout the rulebook. In addition to numerous minor modifications to the content of the rules approved at the 2017 FIE Congress and subsequently approved by the USA Fencing Board of Directors in July 2018, the structure of the rules was substantially revised, with most rules renumbered. This most recent update corrects errata from the previous version, as well as the most recent modifications to the rules. New text from the prior version is marked in green text to facilitate identifying changes, althou gh deleted text and updated numbering is not noted. The USA Fencing Operations Manual is still the definitive organizational rules source for US fencing and provides US specific information as to how tournaments are run. The ongoing publication of an Ameri can version of the FIE Rules has been carried out under the auspices of the Referees Commission (formerly Fencing Officials Commission) of USA Fencing. This current edition is based, in large part on the British translation of the FIE Rules. Over the years , a number of USA Fencing members have been involved in the publication of this book. Omar Bhutta, Ann McBain Ezzell, Bill Oliver, Mary Frye and the translation advice of Nancy Anderson were instrumental in editing previous editions of the rulebook. Many t hanks go out to the current members of the RC Rules Committee for their continued advice and input. I would also like to acknowledge Steve Higginson and the British Fencing Association for their continued assistance in the English translations from the Fre nch, as well as their generous help in keeping track of the myriad changes that occur. Illustrations were graciously provided by Steve Higginson and the British Fencing Association. Some of the images have been modified to contain American English, and som e were recreated in Photoshop to ensure high resolution images. Bradley Baker Editor Berwyn , PA January 1, 2023"

The technical rules of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale d\u2019Escrime were unanimously adopted by the International Congress of National Olympic Committees held at Paris in June 1914 for use in all events at the Olympic Games. They were first codified in 1914 by the Marquis de Chasseloup -Laubat and Monsieur Paul Anspach and issued in 1919 with the title of \u201cRules for Competitions.\u201d 2. They were modified by various FIE Congresses and were revised after the 1931 Congress and again after the 1954 Congress when they were ren amed \u201cTechnical Rules.\u201d They were revised and modernized after the 1958 Congress and renamed \u201cRules for Competitions.\u201d 3. The amendments made by Congress held between 1964 and 1972 were incorporated in the new updated edition published in 1972. The amendments made by Congress between 1973 and 1983 inclusive were incorporated in the new French updated edition published in 1983. Subsequent amendments were included in a restructured edition published in 1997. This edition includes all amendments made before Janua ry 1st, 20 23. Foil i.2 1. The Rules for Foil were adopted on 12 June 1914 by the Committee for Foil of the FIE at a meeting in Paris under the presidency of General G. Ettore, representing the Italian Fencing Federation, who edited the proposed rules. 2. They were basically the same as those drawn up by Monsieur Camille Pr\u00e9vost, President of the Acad\u00e9mie d\u2019Armes and President of the Technical Committee for Foil of the French National Federation. They also conformed to the rules drawn up by the Marquis de Chasseloup -Laubat for \u201cLes Armes de France,\u201d to the various earlier international regulations drawn up by the different countries affiliated to the FIE, and to the Franco - Italian rules. 3. The rules governing foil competitions judged with the electrical judgin g apparatus were adopted in 1957 and modified by various later Congresses up to the present date."

The Rules for \u00c9p\u00e9e drawn up in 1914 coordinated and completed all the various \u00e9p\u00e9e rules which existed prior to the foundation of the FIE and which had been evolved from 1892 both in France and elsewhere, notably by: 2. The Permanent Committee of la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Escrime \u00e0 l\u2019 \u00c9p\u00e9e de Paris, l\u2019Acad\u00e9mie d\u2019 \u00c9p\u00e9e ; la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u2019Entrainement \u00e0 l\u2019Escrime et au Pistolet; and les Armes de France The 1905 International Committee, subject to the laws of each country, regarding the application to dueling L\u2019Union des Soci\u00e9t\u00e9s Fran\u00e7aises de Sport Athl\u00e9tiques (USFSA) Le Comit\u00e9 National des Sports de France The French Olympic Committee The Organizing Committees for the Tournaments held at Nice, on the Riviera, at Ostend, etc. 3. The rules governing \u00e9p\u00e9e competitions judged with the e lectrical judging apparatus were adopted in 1936 and subsequently modified by various later Congresses up to the present date. 4. The Congress of 1984 approved the introduction of Ladies\u2019 \u00c9p\u00e9e ; the Congress of 1987 decided that World Championships for Ladies\u2019 \u00c9p\u00e9e should be organized from 1989 onwards. Sabre i.4 1. The FIE Sabre Rules include the essential portions of the rules which were adopted at the Olympic Games in London in 1908 and in Stockholm in 1912. 2. They also conform to the basic principles of the Ostend rules and of the Hungarian rules and were adopted on 12 June 1914 by the Committee for Sabre of the FIE assembled in Paris under the chairmanship of Dr. Bela Nagy, President of the Hungarian Fencing Federation, who edited the proposed rules. 3. The rul es governing sabre events fenced with an electrical apparatus were adopted in 1988."

Fencing time t.8 Fencing time is the time required to perform one simple fencing action. Offensive and defensive actions t.9 1. The offensive actions are the attack, the riposte and the counter -riposte. \u2014 The attack is the initial offensive action made by extending the arm and continuou sly threatening the opponent\u2019s target, preceding the launching of the lunge or fl\u00e8che (cf. t.56ss , t.75ss ). \u2014 The riposte is the offensive action made by the fencer who has parried the attack. \u2014 The counter -riposte is the offensive action made by the fencer who has parried the riposte. 2. The defensive actions are the parries. \u2014 The parry is the defensive action made with the weapon to prevent an offensive action arriving. Offensive actions The attack t.10 The action is simple when it is executed in one movement and is: \u2014 either direct (in the same line), \u2014 or indirect (in another line). The action is compound when it is executed in several movements. The riposte t.11 The riposte may be immediate or delayed , depending on what action takes place and the speed at which it is carried out. Ripostes are: a) Simple, direct \u2014 Direct riposte : a riposte which touches the opponent without leaving the line in which the parry was made."

Counter -attacks t.12 Counter -attacks are offensive or offensive \u2013defensive actions made during the offensive action of the opponent. 1. The stop hit : a counter -attack made into an attack. 2. The stop hit made with opposition : a counter -attack made while closing the line in which the opponent\u2019s attack will be completed (cf. t.83, t.84, t.85, t.101 ss and t.102 ss). 3. The stop hit made within a period of fencing time , i.e., \u201cin time\u201d (cf. t.88, t.105 ). Other offensive actions t.13 1. The remise A simple and immediate offensive action which follows the original attack, without withdrawing the arm , after the opponent has parried or retreated, when the latter has either quitted contact with the blade without riposting or has made a ripost e which is delayed, indirect or compound. 2. The redoublement A new action , either simple or compound, made against an opponent who has parried without riposting or who has merely avoided the first action by retreating or displacing the target. 3. The reprise of the attack A new attack executed immediately after a return to the on -guard position ."

They are circular (counter -parries) when they are made in the opposite line to that of the attack. The point in line position t.15 The point in line position is a specific position in which the fencer\u2019s sword arm is kept straight and the point of his weapon continually threatens his opponent\u2019s valid target (cf. t.84.1/2/3, t.89.4.e, t.89.5.a, t.102, t.103.3.e, t.106.4.a/b )."

The strip is 14 meters long , so that each competitor, being placed at 2 meters from the center line has at his disposal for retreating a total distance of 5 meters without it being necessary for him to cross the rear limit o f the strip with both feet. 3. The conductive safety borders , indicated in Fig. 1, the diagram of the strips for pools, DE, finals and semi -finals, including the strips already having safety borders, do not form part of the s trip. 4. The distance between the score machine table or stand and the edge of the strip shoul d be between 1 meter and 5 meter s. Any slave score machine must not be placed nearer than 5 meters from the edge of the runback area. t.19 Five lines should be drawn very clearly on the strip at right angles to its length, as follows: 1. one center line which must be drawn as a broken line across the whole width of the strip; 2. two on-guard lines at 2 meters on each side of the center line. These must be dr awn across the whole width of the strip; 3. two lines at the rear limits of the strip, which must be drawn across the whole width of the strip, at a distance of 7 meters from the center line. 4. In addition, the last 2 meters of the strip before these rear limit lines must be clearly distinguished \u2014if possible by a different color of strip \u2014to make it easy for the fencers to be aware of their position on the strip (see Figures 1 and 2)."

Fencers arm, equip and clothe themselves and fence at their own responsibility and at their own risk . 2. It is obligatory for any fencer who warms up or trains with another fencer on site at a USA Fencing competition (including in the training halls linked to the competition) to wear fencing clothing and equipment which conforms with the USA Fencing regulatio ns. Any person giving a lesson must wear at least a fencing master\u2019s plastron, as well as a fencing glove and a mask conforming to the regulations. Any fencer taking a lesson must wear at least a mask and a glove. The Supervisor of the competition or a mem ber of the Bout Committee must penalize any person not respecting this rule with a yellow card, followed by a black card in case of a repeated infringement. 3. The safety measures specified in the Rules and in the standards contained in the Appendix to them a nd the methods of control laid down in the present Rules (cf. Material Rules ) are only designed to increase the fencers\u2019 safety and cannot guarantee it.

With all three weapons, defens ive actions must be effected exclusively with the weapon . 2. If the handle has no special device or attachment or special shape (e.g., orthopedic), a fencer may hold it in any way he wishes and he may also alter the position of his hand on the handle during a bout. However, the weapon must not be \u2014either permanently or temporaril y, in an open or disguised manner \u2014transformed into a throwing weapon ; it must be used without the hand leaving the grip and without the hand slipping along the grip from front to back during an offensive action. 3. When the handle has a special device or attachment or has a special shape (e.g., orthopedic) it must be held in such a way that the upper surface of the thumb is in the same plane as the groove in the blade (in foil or \u00e9p\u00e9e) and perpendicular to the plane of the flexibility of the blade in sabre. 4. The weapon must be used with one hand only ; a fencer may not change hands until the end of the bout, unless the Referee gives special permission in the case of injury to the hand or arm. Coming on guard and placing of the fencers t.22 1. The fencer whose number is called first should place himself on the right of the Referee, except in the case of a bout between a right - and a left -hander, if the left -hander is called first. 2. The team which has the greater number of right -handed fencers should be plac ed on the referee\u2019s right. If both teams have the same number of right - and left -handed fencers, the team called first should be placed on the referee\u2019s right. 3. The Referee places each of the two competitors in such a way that the front foot of each is immediately behind the \u201con-guard\u201d lines). 4. Competitors are always put on guard, whether at the beginning of the bout or subsequently, in the center of the width of the strip . 5. When placed on guard during the bout, the distance between the two competitors mus t be such that, in the point in line position, the points of the two blades cannot make contact. 6. After the scoring of a valid touch the competitors are put on guard in the middle of the strip. 7. If no touch is awarded they are replaced in the position that t hey occupied when the bout was interrupted. 8. At the beginning of each period (in a direct elimination bout) and of any additional minute of fencing time, the fencers are placed on guard in the middle of the strip."

If he already had one foot behind the rear line, he remains in that position. 9. If a fencer crosses the lateral boundaries of the strip , with one or both feet, he must be placed on guard at the correct distance, even if this means that he is placed behind the rear line and thus causes a touch to be awarded against him (cf. t.28, t.102 ). 10. Competitors come on guard when the Referee gives the order \u201cOn guard,\u201d after which the Referee asks, \u201cAre you ready?\u201d On receiving an affirmative reply, or in the absence of a negative reply, he gives the command for fencing to commence with the word \u201cFenc e.\u201d 11. The fencers must come on guard correctly and remain completely still until the command \u201cFence\u201d is given by the Referee. 12.

As soon as the order \u201cHalt\u201d has been given, a competitor may not start a new action; only the movement which has begun before the order was given remains valid. Everything which takes place afterwards is entirely non -valid (But cf. t.44.1/2). 4. If a competitor stops before the word \u201cH alt,\u201d and is touched, the touch is valid. 5. The order \u201cHalt\u201d is also given if the fencing of the competitors is dangerous, confused , or contrary to the Rules , if one of the competitors is disarmed or leaves the strip (cf. t.33, t.58). 6.

Displacing the target and ducking are allowed even if during the action the unarmed hand and/or the knee of the back leg comes into contact with the strip. 2. It is forbidden to turn one\u2019s back on one\u2019s opponent during the bout. Should such an offense occur, the Referee will penalize the fen cer at fault as specified in Articles t.158 -162, t.165 , t.170 and any touch scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. t.28 1. When a fencer goes completely past his opponent during a bout, the Referee must immediately call \u201cHalt\u201d and replace the competitors in the positions which they occupied before the passing took place. 2. When touches are made as a fencer passes his opponent , the touch made immediately is valid; a touch made after passing his opponent by the competitor who has made the passing movement is a nnulled, but the touch made immediately, even when turning around, by the competitor who has been subjected to the offensive action, is valid. 3. If during a bout a fencer who has made a fl\u00e8che attack has a touch registered against him and he continues to run beyond the extreme limit of the strip sufficiently far to cause his reel or the connecting line to his reel to be torn out , the touch which he has received will not be annulled (cf. t.147).

During the bout, the fencer must not, under any circumstances, take hold of any part of the electrical equipment with the non -sword hand (cf. t.158 -162, t.165, t.170 ); any touch scored by t he fencer at fault is annulled. t.30 1. If during a bout the Referee notices that one of the fencers is making use of the non -sword arm and/or hand, or is protecting or covering the valid target with a non -valid surface, the Referee can call for the help of two neutral judges who will be designa ted by the Head Referee. 2. These judges, one on each side of the strip, will watch all aspects of the bout and will indicate, by raising their hand or when asked by the Referee, if the non -sword arm or hand has been used, or if the fencer has protected or co vered the valid target with a non - valid surface (cf. t.49, t.72, t.158 -162, t.165, t.170 ). 3.

Ground gained or lost t.31 When the order \u201cHalt\u201d is given, ground gained is held until a touch has been given.

At each referees\u2019 meeting before any competition, the referees will be asked to declare their potential conflicts of interest to the Refereeing Delegate or the Chair of the Bout Committee. This information must be notified to USA Fencing by the Refereeing Delegate or the Bout Committee Chair . 4. At the end of each round, the Refereeing Delegates can withdraw one or more Referees whose performance was not satis factory. This decision must be taken by the majority of the Refereeing Delegates present. However, a Referee may not be changed during a bout except in exceptional circumstances. In such a case the decision, which must be well founded, must be taken by the majority of the Refereeing De legates present (this rule is equally valid for team competitions). 5. For the final of 4 , the Refereeing Delegates, immediately after the end of the direct elimination tables, select 4 Referees by lot from among at least 4 to 5 Referees, who must be of a dif ferent nationality from any of the fencers. 15 minutes before the final, the Refereeing Delegates will draw lots to assign the Referees for all the bouts for the two semi -finals, in the following order: 1st semi -final, 2nd semifinal. As soon as the two semi -finals are over, the Refereeing Delegates will establish a list of 4 -5 referees and draw lots to assign the Referee and the video consultant for the final, as well as (at the Olympic Games) the Referee and the video consultant of the bout for the 3rd place. 6. The drawing of lots is done with the help of a computer for the whole of the competition right through to the final. The computer program must record each drawing of lots so that it is possible to know which referees were submitted for each draw. Th e computer program should also be able to indicate whether the draw for any round was subsequently redone. 7. In conformity with articles t.50.2 and t.50.3, the designation of the video consultant must be made by drawing lots using a computer program. The nam e and nationality of the video -consultant must also be written on the pool or match sheet, beside those of the referee. Team competitions t.51 The same rules as those in article t.50 3-7 are applied to the team competitions, with two Referees per match. World Cup competitions t.52 Rules described in t.50 and t.51 above are applied by the Bout Committee, assisted for the finals by the official FIE Refereeing delegate.

The materiality of the touch is established according to the indications of the apparatus, and when necessary by consulting the judges (cf. t.48). 2. Only the indications of the electrical apparatus as indicated by its own lamps or by the extension lamps can be taken into consideration for judging touches. Under no circumstances can the Referee declare a competitor to be touched unless the touch has been properly registered by the apparatus (except as provided for in Articles t.79 or when a penalty touch has been awarded). 3. On the other hand, the Referee should, in the cases enumerated for each weapon, annul a touch registered by the apparatus (cf. t.80ss, t.94ss, t.99). Annulment of a touch t.55 1. The Referee will disregard touches which are registered as a result of actions: \u2014 started before the word \u201cFence\u201d or after the word \u201cHalt\u201d (cf. t.23.1/3 ); \u2014 which are made on any object other than the opponent or his equipment. 2. A competitor who intentionally causes the apparatus to register a touch by placing his point on the ground or on any surface other than that of his opponent will be penalized as specifi ed in Articles t.158 -162, t.166, t.170 . t.56 The Referee must also apply the following rules: 1. Only the last touch made before the fault was established can be annulled and then only if it is the competitor against whom the hit was registered who is placed at a disadvantage by the failure. 2. The failure must be established by tests made immediately after the bout was stopped, under the supervision of the Referee and without changing anything whatever of the equipment in use. 3. A competitor who makes any m odification in or who changes his equipment without being asked by the Referee to do so, before the Referee has given his decision, loses all right to the annulme nt of the touch (cf. t.47.2.d). 4. If the bout has effectively recommenced , a competitor cannot c laim the annulment of a touch awarded against him before the said recommencement of the bout. 5. With these tests, one is trying only to establish whether there is material possibility of a mistake in the judgement as a result of a fault. The location of a fault found in the equipment (including the equipment of the competitors) is of no importance for this possible annulment. 6. It is not necessary that the failure found should repeat itself each time a test is made; but it is essential that the fault should b e manifested to the Referee without the possibility of doubt at least once dur ing the tests made by him or under his supervision."

Should such defects be repeated, the Referee must ask a member of the SEMI Commission or an expert technician on duty to verify that the equipment conforms to the Rules. 9. The Referee must ensure that nothing is altered in the competitor\u2019s equipment or in the whole of the electrical apparatus before the expert carries out his check. 10.

Pushing or letting drag the point of the electric weapon on the electric strip is forbidden during the actual bout (between \u201cFence\u201d and \u201cHalt\u201d).

Extension of the valid target t.79 1. In foil, it is forbidden to protect the target area or to substitute another part of the body for the target area by covering it (cf. t.158 -162, t.165, t.170 ); any touch scored by the fencer at fault is annulled. a) If, during the fencing phrase, there is protection or substitution of a valid surface, the fencer at fault will be penalized as specified for offenses of t he 1st group (cf. t.29). b) If, during the fencing phrase, as a result of protection or substitution of a valid surface, a touch correctly given is registered as not valid, the fencer at fault will be penalized as specified for offenses of the 1st group (cf. t.158 -162, t.165, t.170 ) and the touch will be awarded by the Referee. c) However, touches which arrive off the target are counted as valid whenever, by reason of an abnormal position , the fencer ha s substituted this non -valid target for the valid target. 2.

Validity or Priority of the Touch Preface t.82 The Referee alone decides as to the validity or the priority of the touch by applying the following basic rules which are the conventions applicable to foil fencing. Respect of the fencing phrase t.83 1. Every attack , that is , every initial offensive action, which is correctl y executed must be parried or completely avoided and the phrase must be followed through \u2014that is to say, coordinated (cf. t.9.1). 2. In order to judge the correctness of an attack the following points must be considered: 1. The simple attack, direct or indirect (cf. t.10), is correctly executed when the extending of the arm, the point threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the lunge or the fl\u00e8che. 2. The compound attack (cf. t.10) is correctly executed when the arm is extending in the presentation of the first feint, with the point threatening the valid target, and the arm is not bent between the successive actions of the attack and the initiation of the lunge or the fl\u00e8che. 3. The attack with an advance -lunge or an advance -fl\u00e8che is correctly executed when the extending of the arm precedes the end of the advance and the initiation of the lunge or the fl\u00e8che. 4. Actions, simple or compound, steps or feints which are executed with a bent arm , are not considered as attacks but as preparations, laying themsel ves open to the initiation of the offensive or defensive/offensive action of the opponent (cf. t.10-11). t.84 To judge the priority of an attack when analyzing the fencing phrase, it should be noted that:"

If the attack is initiated when the opponent is in the point in line position (cf. t.15), the attacker must, first, deflect the opponent\u2019s blade. Referees must ensure that a mere grazing of the b lades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent\u2019s blade (cf. t.89.5.a). 2. If the attacker, when attempting to deflect the opponent\u2019s blade, fails to find it (d\u00e9robement ), the right of attack passes to the opponent. 3. Continuous steps forward, wit h the legs crossing one another , constitute a preparation and on this preparation any simple attack has priority. t.85 Attacks by beats on the blade: 1. In an attack by beating on the blade, this attack is correctly carried out and retains its priority when the beat is made on the foible of the opponent\u2019s blade, i.e. the two -thirds of the blade furthest from the guard. 2. In an attack by beating on the blade, when the beat is made on the forte of the opponent\u2019s blade, i.e. the one -third of the blad e nearest the guard, the attack is badly executed and the beat gives the opponent the right to an immediate riposte. t.86 The parry gives the right to riposte: the simple riposte may be direct or indirect, but to annul any subsequent action by the attacker, it must be executed immediately, without indecision or delay. t.87 When a compound attack is made, if the opponent finds the blade during one of the feints , he has the right to riposte. t.88 When compound attacks are made, the opponent has the right to stop hit ; but to be valid, the stop hit must precede the conclusion of the attack by an interval of fencing time; that is to say that the stop hit must arrive before the attac ker has begun the final movement of the attack. Judging of touches t.89 The Referee should apply the following basic conventions of foil fencing: 1. When during a phrase, both fencers touch at the same time , there is either a simultaneous action or a double touch . 2. The simultaneous action is due to simultaneous conception and execution of an attack by both fencers; in this case the touches exchanged are annulled for both fencers even if one of them has been touched off the target."

The \u00e9p\u00e9e is a thrusting weapon only. Attacks with this weapon are therefore made only with the point. 2. Pushing or letting the point of the electric weapon drag on the electric strip is forbidden during the actual bout (between \u201cFence\u201d and \u201cHalt\u201d).

If a touch made on the guard of the competitor against whom the touch was registered or on the conductive strip causes the apparatus to register a touch; However, the fact that the \u00e9p\u00e9e of a competitor has large or small areas of insulation formed by oxidation, by glue, paint or any other material on any part of the weapon, on which the opponent\u2019s hits can cause a hit to be signaled, or that the electric ti p is badly fixed to the end of the blade so that it can be unscrewed or tightened by hand, cannot justify the annulment of hits registered against that competitor. 2.

If the incidents mentioned in Article t.94 occur as a result of the competitor\u2019s bodycord being unplugged (either near the hand or at the back of the fencer), they cannot justify the annulment of the touch registered.

However, a hit which arrives following a fencing fault or after going over the lateral boundary of the strip with both feet is not counted as a valid hit, but it stops the fencing phrase and therefo re annuls any subsequent hit. JUDGING OF TOUCHES IN SABRE Materiality and annulment of touches t.99 1. The Referee must take into account any possible malfunctions in the electrical equipment; in particular he must annul a touch he has just awarded in accordance with a signal from the apparatus if it can be established, by tests carried out under his attentive supervision, before the bout has effectively re -started and with no changes having been made to the equipment (cf. t.47.2.d): \u2014 that a touch made by the fencer judged to have been touched does not cause the apparatus to register ; \u2014 that a touch made by the fencer judged to have been touched does not remain fixed on the apparatus; \u2014 that the signal of a touch against the fencer judged to have been touched can be produced either without there having been in fact a valid touch, or by a to uch on the weapon or on a non -valid surface. 2. If the sabre of the fencer judged to have been touched does not conform with Article m.24.6 -8 (insulation of the interior and exterior of the guard, of the handle and of the pommel), there will be no annulment, even if a touch on the weapon causes a signal to register. Validity or priority of the touch Preface t.100 The Referee alone decides as to the validity or the priority of the touch by applying the following basic rules which are the conventions applicable to sabre fencing."

Any attack properly executed (cf. t.9.1) must be parried, or completely avoided, and the phrase must be followed through. 2. The attack is correctly carried out when the extending of the arm, with the point or the cutting edge continuously threatening the valid target, precedes the initiation of the lunge. 3. An attack wi th a lunge is correctly carried out : a) in a simple attack (cf. t.9.1) when the beginning of the extending of the arm precedes the launching of the lunge and the touch arrives at the latest when the front foot touches the strip; b) in a compound attack (cf. t.10) when the beginning of the extending of the arm , on the first feint (cf. t.103 ), precedes the launching of the lunge and the touch arrives at the latest when the front foot touches the strip. 4. An attack with an advance -lunge is correctly carried out : a) in a simple attack (cf. t.9.1) when the beginning of the extending of the arm precedes the advance and when the touch arrives at the latest when the front foot touches the strip; b) in a compound attack (cf. t.10) when the beginning of the extending of the arm for the first feint (cf. t.103 ) precedes the advance, followed by the lunge, and the touch arrives at the latest when the front foot touches the strip. 5.

However, any touch correctly executed by his opponent is valid. t.102 In order to judge the correctness of an attack, the following points must be considered: 1. If the attack is initiated when the opponent has his point in line (cf. t.15) the attacker must first deflect his opponent\u2019s weapon. Referees must ensure that a mere grazing of the blades is not considered as sufficient to deflect the opponent\u2019s blade. 2. If, when attempting to find the opponent\u2019s blade to deflect it, the blade is not found (d\u00e9robement ), the right of attack passes to the opponent. 3. If the attack is commenced when the opponent\u2019s blade is not in line , the attack may be completed either direct, or by a disengagement or by a cutover, or else be preceded by feints (cf. t.103) which oblige the opponent to parry. t.103 1. In compound attacks the f eint must be correctly carried out, i.e.: a) A feint with the point , with the arm extended and the point threatening the target continuously."

If during a compound attack the opponent finds the blade during one of the feints , he has the right to riposte. 3. In a compound attack the opponent has the right to stop hit; but, in order to be valid, the stop hit must precede the last movement of the attack by one period of fencing time, i.e., the stop hit must arrive before the attacker has started the last movement of the attack itself. t.104 Attacks by beats on the blade: 1. In an attack by beating on t he blade, this attack is correctly carried out and retains its priority when the beat is made on the foible of the opponent\u2019s blade , i.e., the two -thirds of the blade furthest from the guard. 2.

The parry gives the right to riposte ; a simple riposte may be direct or indirect, but in order to annul any subsequent movement by the attacker, it must be carried out immediately, without any hesitation or pause. 2. Against cuts with the cutting edge , the flat or the back of the blade, the object of the parry is to pre vent touches made by the opponent arriving on the valid target; therefore: a) The parry is properly carried out when, before the completion of the attack, it prevents the arrival of that attack by closing the line in which that attack is to finish. b) When a parry is properly executed, the attack by the opponent must be declared parried, and judged as such by the Refe ree, even if, as a result of its flexibility , the tip of the opponent\u2019s weapon makes contact with the target.

The articles contained in this chapter refer exclusively to FIE competitions and are for informational purposes only. Individual Competitions o.66 Individual competitions may be organized: a) By direct elimination with a mixed system consisting of one round of eliminating pools and a preliminary direct elimination table, followed by a main direct elimination table of 64 fencers to qualify 8 or 4 fencers for a direct elimination final. b) By direct elimination with a mixed system consisti ng of one round of eliminating pools, followed by a direct elimination table to qualify 8 or 4 fencers for a direct elimination final. c) By direct elimination throughout . (This formula, applicable at the Olympic Games, is contained in an appendix.) A. GENERA L RULES FOR THE ROUND OF POOLS o.67 1. In all competitions for which the formula includes a round of pools , these pools will consist of 7 fencers if the number of participants is divisible by 7. Otherwise the pools will be of 7 and 6. In no case may the pool s be of fewer than 6 fencers. If, however, as the result of the absence of one or more fencers, one or more pools were to be reduced to 5 or fewer fencers, the organizers must add to these pools one or more fencers from other pools of 7 fencers, taking in to account the initial ranking of the fencer(s) being replaced. 2. At World Cup and Grand Prix competitions the organizing country may add the necessary number of fencers of their own nationality for all the pools to consist of 7 fencers. Composition of pools o.68 1. The pools are composed taking account of the latest official FIE ranking, and by drawing lots am ong fencers w ho are not in the ranking. The pools are composed using the following method:"

The allocation of fencers in the pools must be made in such a way as to place fencers of the same nationality in different pools, as far as possible. If a fencer is placed in a pool where there is already a fencer of the same nationality, he is moved one or more places down the ranking until h e is placed in a pool without a fencer of the same nationality. If this is not possible, he must remain in the original pool. 3. The order of fencers on the pool sheet is decided by drawing lots. 4. The pools must be fenced up to the last bout . o.69 The order of bouts in the pools is as follows: Pool of Seven Pool of Six 1-4 5-1 3-5 1-2 5-4 6-4 2-5 4-3 1-6 4-3 1-6 2-3 3-6 6-2 2-4 6-5 3-5 1-4 7-1 5-7 7-3 3-1 4-2 5-2 5-4 3-1 6-5 2-6 5-1 3-6 2-3 4-6 1-2 6-7 7-2 4-7"

All the fencers registered for the team event must be present at the strip before the st art of the match. d) Each team may ask to substitute a fencer before the start of a bout, except in case of injury duly recognized by the Medical delegate, when the substitution can be immediate. There can be only one substitution per match. 3. A fencer who has been replaced because of an injury may not fence again during that match. If both a fencer and the reserve, if any, are forced to retire, or if a fencer is excluded, their team is deemed to have lost the match. 4. The relay system is always applied. The three fencers of a team fence against their opponent of the same category. Each fencer fences his/her opponent twice giving a total of 6 bouts. The bouts are for 5 touches (5 -10-15-20- etc.).

There are three types of weapon: foil, \u00e9p\u00e9e and sabre. 2. All weapons are authorized providing only that they conform to these regulations and to the safety standards which are attached. 3. The weapon should be so constructed that it cannot normally injure either the user or his opponent. All methods of treating a blade between the guard and the tip (point), by grinding, filing or other methods, are forbidden. 4. Sharpening the edges or angles of the point is forbidden. General description m.2 All weapons are composed o f the following parts. 1. A flexible steel blade completed at its forward extremity by a point and at the rear by the tang (the latter included in the grip when the weapon is mounted). 2. A grip within which the tang of the blade is fixed by a locking nut or in any other way, and which enables the fencer\u2019s hand to hold the weapon. It may be composed of one or several parts: in the latter case it is divided into a handle (which is normally held in the hand) and a pommel (rear portion of the grip which locks the handle onto the tang). 3. A metal guard fixed (with the convex face towards the front) between the blade and the grip, serving to protect the sword hand. For foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e, the guard must conta in a padding or cushion (cf. m.5.2 ) to reduce the effect of blows. It will also contain a socket to which the bodycord can be connected. Dimensions (cf. m.7ss , m.15ss , m.21ss ) m.3 Each weapon has its particular design and measurements. 1. The length of the blade includes the point and everything which is added in front of the convex surface of the guard whether or not it is fixed to the latter. 2. The total length of the weapon and its various parts corresponds to the distances between lines (planes) dr awn parallel to each other and perpendicular to the axis of the blade. These lines are situated:"

The total length of the weapon is the distance between lines A and E; the length of the blade that between A and B; the length of the grip that between B and E; and the depth of the guard that between B and C. 4. The maximum total length of the weapon must be less than the greatest permissible length for the blade and the grip added together. These two latter lengths must, therefore, complement each other to arrive at the total length of the weapon. 5. In order to measure either the total length of the weapon or the length of the blade, it is essential that the latter should be without any curve. When measurements are being made, the blade should t herefore be held straight on a flat surface. 6. Only the pommel or the locking nut may be placed between lines D and E. The grip m.4 1. The maximum length of the grip in foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e is 20 cm, measured between lines B and E, and 18 cm, measured between lines B and D. In sabre the maximum length of the grip is 17 cm (see Figures 8 , 9 and 13). 2. The grip must be able to pass through the same gauge as the guard . It must be so made that normally it cannot injure either the user or his opponent. 3. All types of grips are allowed providing that they conform to the regulations which have been framed with a view to placing the various types of weapons on the same footin g. However, at \u00e9p\u00e9e, orthopedic grips, whether metal or not, may not be covered with leather or any material which could hide wires or switches. 4. The grip must not include any device which assists the fencer to use it as a throwing weapon . 5. The grip must not include any device which can increase in any way the protection afforded to the hand or wrist of the fencer by the guard: a cross bar or electric socket which extends beyond the edge of the guard is expressly forbidden. 6. If the grip (or glove) includes any device or attachment or has a special shape (orthopedic) which fixes the position of the hand on the grip, the grip must conform to the following conditions. a) It must determine and fix one position only for the hand on the grip. b) When the hand occupies this one position on the grip, the extremity of the thumb when completely extended must not be more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard."

It must not have a raised rim. 2. a) For foil and \u00e9p\u00e9e, inside the guard there must be a cushion (padding) sufficiently wide to protect the electric wires from the fencer\u2019s fingers. The padding on the inside of the guard must be less than 2 cm thick and must be arranged in such a way as not to increase the protection which the guard affords the hand. b) The connections must be so arranged that it is impossible for the fencer to break or make contacts while fencing. c) On foils , the wire must be protected by an insulating sheath. d) On \u00e9p\u00e9es , the two wires must be protected by two insulating sheaths, one on each wire. e) Both the wire and the insulating sheath must go right up to the socket. f) In no case may uninsulated wires project beyond the point where they are attached to the socket (cf. m.29 , m.31 ). 3.

In USA Fencing competitions, there is no requirement that the pointe d\u2019arr\u00eat must be homologated. b) In order that the registering of hits by the contact of the point on the opponent be correctly registered by the scoring device, the pointes d\u2019arr\u00eat must be clean. The electrical resistance measured in ohms must not exceed the limit of 2 ohms ( m.5.4.a ). c) The blades and the guards in \u00e9p\u00e9e, foil and sabre must be totally of metal. Apart from in sabre where the part of the guard next to the pommel is insulated (insulating sheath), their exteriors must not be covered by any material (plastic or other). The guard may not feature any advertising. This is also the case for the insulated part of the sabre guard. d) Any fencer or other person who tries to register touches in a way that does not comply with the rules, either with the weapon or by manipulating the scoring device, will be excluded from the competit ion or from the competition zone and, after identification, will be liable to further penalty."

To carry out t his supervision, three members of the above -mentioned Commission must be appointed and put in charge of this work. However, when the organizing country possesses somebody competent, recognized as such by the SEMI Commission of the FIE, two members of the a bove Commission will be appointed. 3. The delegates of the SEMI Commission of the FIE have the right at any time to seize a weapon, a bodycord, a conductive jacket or any item of equipment or clothing for examination. CHECKING OF FENCERS\u2019 EQUIPMENT m.37 1. In al l official FIE competitions the fencers are responsible for their equipment (including weapons and clothes) at the moment they present themselves on the strip. 2. In particular, blades, masks and clothing must all carry the label of guarantee specified in the safety standards appended to these Rules. 3. The forms of checking laid down by these Rules are only intended to help organizers who must apply the Rules and fencers who must always respect these Rules. These checks can, therefore, in no way absolve any fencers who break the Rules from responsibility. Presentation of equipment to the Weapon Checking Center m.38 1. Fencers are obliged to present themselves at the Weapon Checking Center, at the time advised in the timetable of each official competition of the FIE, with the equipment they intend to use during the event in question. The number of articles handed to the Checking Center is limited to four weapons, three bodycords, two conductive jackets, two masks and three mask -to-jacket leads per fencer. 2. Each competitor must submit his weapons in a fencing bag at the Weapon Checking Center reception. An inventory of the equipment is made by an organizing official and a label is put on the bag, indicating the name of the country of the competitor. The bags are stored in the order in which they arrive, and are che cked in the same order. 3. Provision should be made for weapons and clothing to be submitted on the morning of the day before the competition .

Because the amount of wire which the reels can carry is limited, the conductive strip is designed for use on a strip 14 m long ; an extension of 1.5 \u20132 m is added at each end of the strip to allow the fencer crossing the rear limits of the strip to retire on an even and unvarying surface. The conductive strip must therefore have a length of 17 \u201318 m. 5. a) It is preferable to lay the conductive stri p on a wooden base with some flexible material between. It must be provided with some device which enables it to be kept well stretched. b) The wooden bases are 12\u201315 cm above ground level. Their sides must not be sloping. c) It is preferable to have a metal str ip, screwed down if possible, which will keep down the edges of the conductive strip along the entire length of the base on both sides. d) Strips made of metallic mesh must never be placed directly on a floor of reinforced concrete or tiles. 6. The paint used to draw the lines on the conductive strip must not prevent its electrical conductibility, so that a touch made on it at a point where a line occurs is also neutralize d. 7. The organizers must have equipment for the immediate repair of the strip available on the spot. 8. There must be no roller or any sort of obstacle at the ends of the conductive strips which could prevent the fencers from retreating normally. 9. Strips used in the World Championships and in the Olympic Games must be tested before competition by SEMI Commission Delegates using the Slip -Meter. 10. The specifications of the Slip -Meter must fulfill the specifications defined in the homologation manual."

The homologation procedure is carried out by the FIE SEMI Commission under the supervision of an Executive Committee representative. The homologation certificate is delivered following the successful passing of the homologation process described hereafter. The manufacturer must wait for the result of the homologation process to be published and for the certificate to be issued prior to beginning production and/or c ommercialization. The FIE SEMI Commission is composed of 10 elected members and the FIE COMEX representative and, in case of need, the SEMI Commission may consult experts from different fields to ensure the quality and expertise of the homologation process . For software homologation, a delegate from the Rules Commission is mandatory. For video -refereeing, a delegate from the Refereeing Commission is mandatory. Field of application: Homologation is compulsory for blades, points, protective clothing (jackets, breeches and under plastrons) including masks and gloves, fencing scoring apparatuses (both with wires and wireless), strips, video refereeing systems and competition management software. This list is not exhaustive and can be extended at any time by the Executive Committee. Homologation process: 1) The homologation request must be addressed in written form to the President of the SEMI Commission. The request must contain all the documents requested in the appropriate technical handbook. 2) The President of the SEMI checks the request for theoretical conformity (completeness of the file, complying descriptions\u2026) and replies within 14 days to the person making the request. An application which fails is sent back to the person making the request wi th explanations for the rejection. A successful application is forwarded to the FIE SEMI Commission members with a copy to the person making the request. 3) The Manufacturer and the independent Institute of his choice should both send the laboratory complianc y test results to the President of the SEMI Commission, together with the request for homologation. The only specialized institutes approved by the SEMI are CRITT, Denkendorf and IFTH for clothing (jackets, breeches and under plastron) and masks; and CRITT , Sofranel and Visti for blades."

The section of blade involved in the test must be approximately 155 mm long, of which 60 mm from the point must not sustain any deformation. A cycle consists of one bending plus one straightening. The result of the test is represented by the number of cycles completed before the blade breaks. To check safety conditions during the normal use of blades, the samples tested must be subjected to a series of alternate bendings at a fre quency of not more than 1 Hz (1 Hz = 1 cycle per second), verifying that the blade does not break before: \u2014 400 cycles for foil; \u2014 150 cycles for \u00e9p\u00e9e, when the cycles have been conducted in accordance with the method described above. 6.9. Fatigue resistance test of blades (by bending or cyclical buckling) In order to examine the behavior of the blades during normal fencing activity, the blades to be tested must undergo a test of their resistance to metal fatigue, with a special apparatus, either me chanical or pneumatic, homologated by the FIE SEMI Commission. The test consists of bending the blade without exceeding the limit of elasticity of the material, i.e., to the point where a bend of approximately 220 mm is reached, corresponding to a shorten ing of the blade by approximately 250 mm, and then allowing it to straighten. The test machine must be able to allow the bending and straightening of the blade at a frequency of 1 Hz (1 Hertz = 1 cycle per second). The test benches are designed to reproduc e the stresses to which a blade is subjected in normal fencing activity. The stresses do not go beyond the limits of the elasticity of the blades; a permanent deforming of the blade should not take place. The number of bends to which a blade is subjected b efore breaking defines its resistance to metal fatigue. The test benches can be used for bending either without impact (with the end of the blade attached to a revolving support) or with impact (with the end of the blade unattached). The test should contin ue until the blade breaks. For the result to be acceptable, it must be ascertained that the blade does not break before: \u2014 18,000 cycles for foil blades; \u2014 7,000 cycles for \u00e9p\u00e9e blades. 6.10.

S hape , Dimensions and Methods of Production of the Elements of Fencing Masks Technical Specification for the Manufacture of Fencing Masks 1. Purpose These technical specifications concern the shape, the dimensions, the methods of production of the essential constituent elements of protective fencing masks, as well as the technical quality of the materials intended for their manufacture. 2. General conditions All the mate rials of which fencing masks are made and the corresponding manufacturing processes must ensure an excellent mechanical resistance, a high degree of visibility and comfort for the fencer and a sufficient resistance to wear and tear and aging. 3. Shape and dim ensions of masks The shape of masks is indicated schematically in Figure A.3 (viewed from the front, from the side and from above). The dimensions of the frontal grille depend on the dimensions of the mask. Those of the side grille must be as follows: the height corresponding to 3/4 that of the front grille; the width being between 10 and 12 cm. Figure A.3. Design of masks 4. Essential constituent elements The essential elements of the mask, as shown in Figure A.3 , are: a) frontal grille protecting the face;"

The other parts, such as the interior protecting facings, padding, elastic bands and the safety retaining devices, whose production is entrusted to the manufacturer, must entirely conform to the conditions required for their use. In particular, the rear fixing devices must ensure that the mask is located in the correct position on the fencer\u2019s head and that it remains in a perfect position, even after blows or shocks. 4.1. Front and side mesh The mesh must be made of woven material with a square aperture, with an opening of 1.9 mm, made entirely of round stainless steel wire CrNi 18 -10 (the technical quality of the wire for which is addressed in Table V ). In the curved zone of the grille the presence of mesh with an opening greater in size than that specified is permissible, on condition that it does not exceed 2.1 mm. The frontal grille must form an interior angle of \u2264 130\u00b0, corr esponding to the fold of the center line. 4.2. Junction of the frontal and lateral mesh to the reinforcement band The joining of the frontal mesh to the lateral one, by the reinforcement band, can be accomplished by a mechanical joining (for example metal wire stitching, use of rivets), or by solder. In the case of solder, which in any case must be done using the usual techniques for stainless steel, the operation must be completed by a careful mechanical polishing of the soldered area, to eliminate slag and res idues. The mesh must be entirely covered in paint with a polymer base. Any heat treatments to harden and stabilize the painting must be carried out at a temperature of \u2264 400\u00b0C. 4.3. Bibs The bib must be formed from several layers of cloth firmly fixed to each o ther, of which at least one on the inside must be made of Kevlar fiber or a similar substance; in any case the cloth so formed must ensure a high degree of resistance to penetration equal or greater than 350 Newton; it must also hinder the forming of stiff creases or the rolling up of the bib itself. The bib must be fixed to the exterior of the grille starting from the reinforcement band onwards and extending as protection for the neck for a total height of the order of 10 \u201312 cm."

Standards for the Manufacture of Clothing For the manufacture of fencing clothing it is obligatory to use material which is able to resist perforation by a force of at least 800 Newtons. This resistance must be verified by the tests defined in the followin g paragraphs. 3.1 Resistance of Cloth against Perforation Standards for Testing the Resistance of Cloth against Perforation 1. Generalities The method which is the subject of this standard is intended to determine the resistance against perforation of cloth used to make up fencing uniforms. The perforation load is defined as the maximum value of impact registered before the sample of cloth is perforated by the test probe: the load is expressed in Newtons or else in kilograms of force to one decimal plac e. 2. Methods of conducting the test 2.1. The test takes place using a high speed dynamometer (as, for example, the INSTROM 1273 apparatus) fitted with a moving test probe 3 mm long, with a square section, a pyramidal head and an angle at the tip of 120\u00b0 (see Figu re A.4, section A ); this probe must be made of high speed or super high speed steel, with a length of 70 mm, of which at least 50 mm juts out from the holding device (see Figure A.4, section B ). 2.1.1. The travel of the point must be perpendicular to the surface of the cloth during the course of the test. 2.1.2. The speed of the probe during the test component of its travel must be more than 6 m/s. 2.2. The test must be conducted in a place where the temperature is 20 \u201325\u00b0C and with a relative humidity of 50 \u201355%. 2.3. The samples f or the test must be taken from a piece of cloth around 50 cm high, free of faults and obtained at random at a distance of at least 2 m from the ends. The samples must be square in shape with sides of 14 \u201315 cm and they must be fixed on a device with a doubl e vice (see Figure A.5 ) while leaving a section of 50 mm diameter free for the test. In the case of fabrics made of several separated layers of cloth, a continuous seam must be sewn along the sides of the square of material which constitutes the sample. 2.4. The samples of cloth must be brought to the area where the test will take place at least two hours before the test. 2.5. During the test the force applied by the probe must be registered under the proper conditions of temperature and humidity. The end of the scal e for measuring the forces must not be more than 5000 Newton (with a tolerance of \u00b1 5 Newton)."

A. Fo il 1. T he Central Judging Apparatus (cf. m.51 ) Principles 1. The apparatus registers when a break occurs in the circuit of the foil, that is to say that the electrical current which is circulating permanently in the foil circuit is broken when a touch is made. 2. The apparatus will show a red signal on one side and a green signal on the other when a touch is registered on target; white signals will indicate touches off the target on either side. 3. The audible signals will consist either of a short ring, or of a continuous note which will be automatically limited to two seconds. Either sort of sound will occur whenever a visual signa l appears. The sound signal must be identical for both sides of the apparatus. 4. After registering a touch, whether on target or off target, the apparatus must no longer be able to register a subsequent touch on target on the same side of the apparatus. 5. No p riority must be indicated between a touch registered against one competitor and a touch registered against his opponent. 6. After a period of time of 300 milliseconds (\u00b1 25 milliseconds tolerance) after the first touch signaled by the apparatus (this period o f time bears no relationship to \u201cfencing time\u201d which is the basis of judging according to the conventions governing foil fencing), the latter must ignore all signals for subsequent touches. b) Sensitivity and regularity 1. Any touch must cause a signal what ever the resistance of the circuits external to the apparatus. The duration of the break of contact which must always ensure that a signal is registered must be 14 milliseconds (\u00b1 1 ms of tolerance). Depending on the increase in the resistance, the apparat us may register: 1) a valid touch only; 2) a valid touch and a non-valid touch simultaneously; 3) a non -valid touch only. The resistance must always be less than 500 ohms for 1) and 2). 2. The registering of a valid touch must be guaranteed when there is a break of contact of 13 to 15 milliseconds, when the exterior resistance is between of 0 and 500 ohms. 3. The contact time is the same for valid and non -valid touches."

The apparatus must be capable of supporting an increase in the resistance in the closed circuit of the foils of up to 200 ohms, without causing a \u201cnon -valid\u201d signal to register. 5. Even if the resi stance of the foil earth circuit is increased up to 100 ohms, none of the following irregular phenomena must occur: \u2014 that touches are registered on the guard or on the strip; \u2014 that it is possible to obtain the registration of a touch merely by contact of the blade or the pointe d\u2019arr\u00eat (without depressing it) on the conductive jacket of either competitor. 6. When the blades are in contact, irrespective of the resistance in ohms between them, the apparatus must be capable of registering normally the touche s exchanged, valid and non - valid. 7. A specification for tests of apparatus under different conditions will be supplied on request by the SEMI Commission of the FIE. 8. A specification for tests also includes the control of functioning of the yellow lamps. 9. The C ongress of the FIE has authorized this Commission to modify or complete the above requirements whenever technical improvements allow the construction of apparatus which can ensure the better operation of the electrical foil judging apparatus."

Depending on the resistance of the return circuit of the opponent\u2019s foil, the apparatus must register a valid touch up to 200 ohms and non -valid touches above this value. The apparatus must be equipped with two yellow lamps regulated as follows. The yellow lamp on the side of either fencer must automatically light up and remain alight as soon as the resistance between the conductive jacket of that fencer and his weapon is less than 450 ohms. When this resistance is in excess of 475 ohms, the yellow lamp should never light up. These yellow lamps serve only to indicate insulation faults. If one or both of the yellow lamps remain lit up, the Referee must stop the bout and call the technical experts on duty to eliminate the fault. The yellow l amps must not indicate any contact between the fencer\u2019s conductive jacket and the conductive strip."

Timing The apparatus must register only the first touch which is made. If the interval of time between two touches is less than 40 milliseconds (1/25th of a second), the apparatus must register a double touch (both signal lamps must light up simultaneously). When the interval is greater than 50 milliseconds (1/20th of a second) the apparatus must register only one touch (only one signal lamp is lit). The tolerance allowed for timing the apparatus is that between these two limits (1/25th and 1/20th of a second). Sensitivity When the external resistance is normal, that is 10 ohms, the apparatus must register touches when these are made with a duration of contact of 2 \u201310 milliseconds. With an exceptional external resistance of 100 ohms the apparatus must still register a touch, but without any specific duration of contact. The apparatus must not register signals of less than 2 milliseconds durat ion. Non -registration The apparatus must not register touches which are made on the earthed material (on the guard or on the conductive strip), even when there is a resistance of 100 ohms in the earth circuit. e) Visual signals 1. Visual signals include at least two signal lamps on each side of the apparatus, so designed that if one lamp does not function it does not prevent the other from lighting up nor cause an excessive current through the latter. 2. The signal lamps should give a red signal on one side of the apparatus and a green signal on the other. 3. The apparatus should have a pilot light to show that it is switched on. This light should be dim and not colored. 4. The apparatus may include lights which indicate shorts. These should be orange in color. 5. The l ight-bulbs which show when touches are registered are usually covered with translucent shades. It must, however, be possible to remove these shades and use naked lights, when the light conditions in the locality make it desirable to do so (strong sunlight or, exceptionally, in the open air). f) Audible signals The apparatus must have a loud sound signal. The apparatus may include a device which allows the sound signal to be stopped before the apparatus is reset."

The apparatus works by contact between any uninsulated part of the sabre and the conductive surface of the opposing fencer\u2019s jacket, glove and mask. 2. For touches made on these valid conductive surfaces, the apparatus shows a red light on one side and a green li ght on the other. If the guard or blade of a fencer\u2019s sabre is in contact with the conductive surface of his own equipment (signaled by a yellow light), a valid touch made by that fencer must still register. 3. The audible signal will consist of either one sh ort ring or a continuous note lasting 1 \u20132 seconds, simultaneous with the light signals. The sound will be the same for both sides of the apparatus. 4. Touches made on non -conductive surfaces must not be signaled. 5. The apparatus must be equipped with two yellow lamps, one on each side, which will indicate a contact between the guard or blade of a fencer\u2019s sabre and the conductive surface of his own equipment. 6. The apparatus must be equipped with two white lamps, identical to those on a foil apparatus, which if pe rmanently illuminated, accompanied by a sound signal, indicate any abnormal electrical change in circuits B and C of the fencer at fault. 7. The apparatus must not signal a touch made by the blade whipping over to touch the opponent while in contact with his blade or guard. 8. After a touch has been registered, a subsequent touch made by the other fencer will only be registered if it occurs within a maximum delay of 170 milliseconds (\u00b1 10 ms of tolerance). 9. When the two blades touch, all the other rules should be strictly applied. 10. The SEMI Commission of the FIE reserves the right to change the rules governing the apparatus, either to simplify o r to improve its performance. Sensitivity and regularity 1. The duration of contact during which a signal should be ensured sh ould be 0.1 \u20131 milliseconds. These times may be varied in the light of experience and of laboratory tests carried out by the SEMI Commission. An apparatus will be rejected if a touch can be registered with a duration of contact of less than 0.1 milliseconds (time subject to modification). 2. The apparatus should allow an increase in the exterior resistance of the connections up to 100 ohms without any drawbacks. 3. Should a fault in the insulation, down to 0 ohms, cause a leakage of current between a fencer\u2019s vali d conductive surface and his weapon, the apparatus should still be capable of registering all touches exchanged. The insulation fault will be signaled by the illumination"
